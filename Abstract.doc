<p>We identified microorganisms participating in xylose and/or cellulose decomposition in soil microcosms using nucleic acid stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled to next generation sequencing. 49 and 63 OTUs assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Microorganisms assimilated xylose-C at days 1, 3, and 7. Cellulose-C assimilation peaked at day 14 and was maintained at day 30. Many SIP-identified cellulose degraders are members of cosmopolitan but physiologically uncharacterized soil microbial lineages including <em>Spartobacteria</em>, <em>Chloroflexi</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from Xylose was initially assimilated by <em>Firmicutes</em> followed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actionbacteria</em>. Trophic interactions may have caused this temporal pattern of incorporation. Soil C cycling models, however, often disregard bacterial trophic interactions. Fast growing substrate specialists assimilated xylose-C and slow growing substrate specialists assimilated cellulose-C. Xylose-C assimilators within time points clustered phylogenetically, and cellulose-C assimilators clustered phylogenetically overall. Knowledge of soil C-cycling functional guild diversity, membership and activity will improve the predictive power of terrestrial C flux models.</p>
