<p>We identify microorganisms participating in the transformation of xylose or cellulose in soil microcosms by using nucleic acid stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled to next generation sequencing. Microcosms were incubated with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose or <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and microcosm DNA was interrogated for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-incorporation at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30. A total of 49 and 63 unique OTUs assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose into microcosm DNA was observed at days 1, 3, and 7, while incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose peaked at day 14 and was maintained at day 30. Importantly, many cellulose degraders identified in this study are members of cosmopolitan but physiologically uncharacterized soil microbial lineages including <em>Spartobacteria</em>, <em>Chloroflexi</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose additions precipitated a temporal cascade of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-incorporation activity that could be due to significant predatory interactions among bacteria yet intra-bacteria predatory interactions are rarely considered in soil C cycling conceptual models. Microorganisms that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose were faster growing and displayed less substrate specificity than microorganisms that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose as assessed by predicted <em>rrn</em> gene copy number for each OTU and OTU DNA buoyant density shifts in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling. Also, microorganisms that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose were phylogenetically overdispersed whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose assimilating microorganisms were phylogenetically constrained. Describing the ecology and identities of soil C cycling microorganisms will calibrate and inform predictions of terrestrial carbon flux in response to climate change and land management. Tuning terrestrial C flux models with appropriate parameters for soil biomass is crucial for reconciling contrasting predictions of soil as a future C sink and source.</p>
