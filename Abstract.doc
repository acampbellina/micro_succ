<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We describe a high-resolution approach for identifying microbial contributions to soil C-cycling dynamics using nucleic acid stable isotope probing coupled with next generation sequencing (HR-SIP). We amended series of soil microcosms with a complex mixture of model carbon (C) substrates and inorganic nutrients similar to plant biomass. A single C constituent in the C substrate mixture was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled equivalent in each microcosm series. Specifically, in separate microcosms we substituted <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose or <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose for their unlabeled equivalents. Xylose and cellulose were chosen to represent labile soluble C and polymeric insoluble C, respectively. Microcosm DNA was interrogated for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30. Incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose into microcosm DNA was observed at days 1, 3, and 7, while incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose was peaked at day 14 and was maintained through day 30. Of over 6,000 OTUs detected, a total of 49 and 63 unique OTUs assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Xylose assimilating OTUs were more abundant in the microcosm community than cellulose assimilating OTUs, while cellulose OTUs demonstrated a greater substrate specificity than xylose OTUs. Xylose responders exhibited a unique time signature from days one to seven, manifested by a succession from <em>Firmicutes</em>, to <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, to <em>Actinobacteria</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose incorporating OTUs included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>
