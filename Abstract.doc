<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We describe an approach for identifying microbial contributions to soil C cycling using nucleic acid stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with next generation sequencing. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose or <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose were chosen to carry the isotopic label for DNA-SIP. Microcosm DNA was interrogated for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30. Incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose into microcosm DNA was observed at days 1, 3, and 7, while incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose peaked at day 14 and was maintained through day 30. From approximately 6,000 OTUs detected, a total of 49 and 63 unique OTUs assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Xylose assimilating OTUs were more abundant in the microcosm community than cellulose assimilating OTUs, while cellulose OTUs demonstrated a greater substrate specificity than xylose OTUs.</p>
