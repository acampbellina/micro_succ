\section{Abstract}
We describe an approach for identifying microbial contributions to soil
C cycling using nucleic acid stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with next
generation sequencing. $^{13}$C-xylose or $^{13}$C-cellulose were chosen to
carry the isotopic label for DNA-SIP. Microcosm
DNA was interrogated for $^{13}$C incorporation at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 
30. Incorporation of $^{13}$C from xylose into microcosm DNA
was observed at days 1, 3, and 7, while incorporation of $^{13}$C from
cellulose peaked at day 14 and was maintained through day 30. From
approximately 6,000 OTUs detected, a total of 49 and 63 unique OTUs assimilated
$^{13}$C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Xylose assimilating
OTUs were more abundant in the microcosm community than cellulose assimilating
OTUs, while cellulose OTUs demonstrated a greater substrate specificity than
xylose OTUs.
