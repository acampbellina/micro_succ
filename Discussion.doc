<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology research but cultured isolates have not captured <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant genera <span class="citation">(1)</span>. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble and polymeric C degraders. Included in <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="microbial-response-to-isotopic-labels">Microbial response to isotopic labels</h2>
<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was assimilated in succession by slower growing <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were either tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-soil-microorganisms-participating-in-the-decomposition-of-organic-matter">Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the decomposition of organic matter</h2>
<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(2)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). Ecological metrics suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher <em>rrn</em> gene copy number. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTU <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers. Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric C responder ecological strategies perhaps because <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes.</p>
<p>NRI values are useful metrics to probe evolution-ecology relationships and have recently been used to assess soil OTUs categorized by their response to wet up (CITE Firestone and Wallenstein). Ecological groups defined in a long term repeated wet up experiment over XX weeks varied in phylogenetic clustering whereas groups defined by assessing relative abundance patterns within a single wet up event were largely phylogenetically clustered (CITE). To our knowledge clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship with a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously (CITE Martiny) and the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose response trait depth observed in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in cellulose degradation (CITE). Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be transferred between species and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically. It’s not clear, though, if all <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple groups in a trophic cascade.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(3)</span> which in turn can influence soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(4)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is an important step in predicting how biogeochemical process rates can change with community composition <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. Biogeochemical processes carried out by few taxa or “narrow” guilds are influenced more significantly by changes in community composition than processes carried out by greater numbers of taxa <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to be carried out by “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds, respectively <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). The cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]); of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose. Interestingly, while xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were largely clustered near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI <span class="math"> &gt; </span> 0) at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). When grouped at greater phylogenetic depth <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders can be distributed into even fewer clades than OTUs (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). This suggests <em>active</em> cellulose and xylose responder groups were “narrow” in that few lineages relative to total observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose decomposition.</p>
<p>We propose two scenarios for how changes in community composition can affect C cycling based on our study. For cellulose decomposition, our results suggest that cellulose degradation is a conserved and narrowly distributed trait <em>in situ</em>. Therefore, changes in community composition could greatly reduce the number of microorganisms capable of cellulose degradation and reduce cellulose decomposition process rates. For xylose, on the other hand, community shifts might not change the number of xylose decomposers. Rather, since we observed phylogenetically and ecologically coherent groups respond to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose within time points, changes in soil community composition might elicit wholesale shifts primary xylose decomposers from one phylogenetic group to another. Process rates may not change if the number of xylose decomposers is rate limiting, but, different and phylogenetically coherent groups of xylose decomposers may differently allocate C resources and precipitate a different trophic cascade thus influencing soil C fate if not dynamics.</p>
<p>The activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition is a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation of functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Further, the activity peak of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> occurred with a concomitant decrease in <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance. Considering that <em>Agromyces</em> and certain <em>Bacteroidetes</em> types are likely soil predators <span class="citation">(6, 7)</span> one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in abundance of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> is that the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders are consumed by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though intra-bacteria trophic interactions in soil C cycling are often not considered (e.g. <span class="citation">(8)</span>).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(9)</span>. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators.
