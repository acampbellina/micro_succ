<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology research but culturing has not captured <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant soil genera <span class="citation">(1)</span>. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these OTUs. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs included members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="microbial-response-to-isotopic-labels">Microbial response to isotopic labels</h2>
<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): Labile C such as xylose was first assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> aerobic spore formers. The remaining labile C biomass C from growing <em>Firmicutes</em> was assimilated in succession by <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates was decomposed by bacteria after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>

<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating each OTU’s the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(2)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). Ecological metrics predict <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance members of the bulk community than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher <em>rrn</em> gene copy number. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs that responded beginning at day 3 had greater <em>rrn</em> gene copy number than OTUs that responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose later (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>NRI values are useful metrics for assessing phylogenetic clustering <span class="citation">(3)</span> and have recently been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs categorized by response to wet up <span class="citation">(4, 5)</span>. To our knowledge assessing the phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship with a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously <span class="citation">(6)</span> and the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose response trait depth observed in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be transferred between species via horizontal gene transfer and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically. It’s not clear, though, if all <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(8)</span> which in turn can influence soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(9)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates can change with community composition <span class="citation">(8, 10)</span>. Biogeochemical processes that are the aggregate of many subprocesses such as soil respiration involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation and a smaller suite of microbial participants <span class="citation">(10)</span>. Within an aggregate process such as decomposition, subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow processes <span class="citation">(8)</span>. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to be carried out by “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds, respectively <span class="citation">(8)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also, it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). The cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]); of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose. Interestingly, while xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were largely clustered near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI <span class="math"> &gt; </span> 0) at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). Therefore <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders can be distributed into even fewer clades than number of OTUs (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). The consenTRAIT estimate for the breadth of the xylose use trait is X.XX, for instance, while our OTUs were established at 0.03 sequence identity divergence. <em>Active</em> cellulose and xylose responder groups were “narrow” in that few lineages relative to total observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose decomposition but there is not working quantitative definition of what constitutes “narrow” versus “broad” in the literature. HGT SENTENCE.</p>
<p>For community composition to influence ecological processes several criteria must be satisfied CITE Schimel 2012: microorganisms must differ in functional capacity, and biological reactions must influence C fate or be rate limiting. We demonstrate that the microbes participating in cellulose decomposition are largely different than those participating in xylose decomposition which satisfies the first criterion above. The other criteria were not directly tested in our study but we propose several mechanisms suggested by our results wherein C dynamics and fate would be affected by community composition. Genomic evidence shows cellulose degradation is likely a conserved trait CITE Allison. To our knowledge this study is the first to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation of cellulose degradation <em>in situ</em> via DNA-SIP and our results are remarkably consistent with genomic evidence. A decrease in active cellulose degraders could decrease cellulose decomposition process rates as the phylogenetic conservation of cellulose degradation likely means few soil microorganisms can fill the cellulose degradation niche. If cellulose decomposers are readily dispersed, however, dispersed microorganisms could fill the cellulose degradation void renewing ecosystem function. For labile C decomposition, if dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization CITE, a decrease in fast growing spore former abundance could enable the labile C degradation niche to be occupied by different labile C degraders. The primary labile C degraders in this study were fast growers, and have a distinct lifestyle (spore formation) which might indicate a distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation signature. Both attributes are unlikely to be mimicked by substitution with a different functional group and thus this substitution might influence labile C dynamics and fate. Further, it is unclear how labile C degrader substitution would affect biomass C turnover by predatory bacteria that appeared to feed on fast growing, spore forming labile C decomposers. Spore formation, however, might enable dispersal. The consistency of labile C decomposition rates across soils is hypothesized to be a manifestation of the wide ability to use labile materials across microorganisms CITE. An alternative hypothesis is that labile C degraders are easily dispersed. Other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE Placella and Many soil <em>Actinobacteria</em> form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, however, but our results suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resusitated, hyphal <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE may impact labile C dynamics and fate.</p>
<p>The activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition is a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation of the activity of functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(11, 12)</span>, however, and the activity peak of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> occurred with a corresponding decrease in <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance. Considering that <em>Agromyces</em> and certain <em>Bacteroidetes</em> types are likely soil predators one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in abundance of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> is that the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders were consumed by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though intra-bacteria trophic interactions in soil C cycling are rarely considered (e.g. <span class="citation">(13)</span>).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(14)</span>. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators.
