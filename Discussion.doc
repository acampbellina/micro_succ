<p>DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 agricultural soil OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these OTUs. We propose C added to soil microcosms took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers first assimilated labile C followed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes. The <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes may have also preyed on the rapidly responding <em>Firmicutes</em>. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> and members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups like <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, decomposed cellulose and cellulose C incorporation into microbial biomass plateaued at day 14 and was maintained through day 30.</p>

<p>We assessed <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTU ecological strategy by estimating each OTU’s <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(1)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance members of the bulk community than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The high abundance of xylose responders may also be due in part to high <em>rrn</em> gene copy number. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs that incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into biomass at day one had greater <em>rrn</em> gene copy number than OTUs that responded later to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering <span class="citation">(2)</span> and have been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil wet up <span class="citation">(3, 4)</span>. To our knowledge assessing the phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship with a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously <span class="citation">(5)</span> and the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose response trait depth observed in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of an readily horizontally transferred trait and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically or in this case may indicate that the group comprises many traits. It’s not clear which <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups. Temporally defined <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, however, are clearly phylogenetically coherent (Figure XX, Figure XX). For example, most day 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are members of the <em>Paenibacillus</em> (see Supplemental Note XX).</p>
<p>Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution of diagnostic genes in genomes or from screening culture collections for a particular trait CITE. For instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms participate in glucose turnover CITE. <em>in situ</em> functional guild diversity, however, can vary significantly from diversity assessed by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution among genomes and more a function of lifestyle. Soil is characterized by pulse delivery of nutrients and resources that coincide with environmental phenomena including seasonal change CITE, land management CITE, and rainfall CITE. Therefore, rapid growth rates and/or the rapid resuscitation upon wet up CITE may control labile soil C assimilation. Growth rate and dessication resistance are phylogenetically conserved unlike labile C degradation CITE so labile C assimilation may be constrained by more phylogenetically conserved lifestyles. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing <em>in situ</em> phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because DNA-SIP can incorporate life history strategies by targeting active <em>in situ</em> microorganisms. Snapshot estimates of community composition inform soil structure function studies CITE Fierer though labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot community structure but rather to community structure dynamics. Fast growing spore formers would not need to maintain high abundance to significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered resources. This accentuates the usefulness of DNA-SIP for describing soil ecology as DNA-SIP assesses the activity which can be decoupled from snapshot abundance.</p>

<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(7)</span> which in turn influences soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(8)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change with community composition <span class="citation">(7, 9)</span>. Aggregate biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses such as soil respiration involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation by a smaller suite of microbial participants <span class="citation">(9)</span>. Within an aggregate process such as decomposition, subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to be carried out by “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds, respectively <span class="citation">(7)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also, it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership – of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose – and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders largely clustered near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI <span class="math"> &gt; </span> 0) at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). Therefore <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders distribute into fewer clades than OTUs (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders formed clades at deption of X.XX sequence divergence (consenTrait) while our OTUs were established at 0.03 sequence divergence. <em>Active</em> cellulose and xylose responder groups were “narrow” in that few lineages relative to total observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose decomposition but there is no quantitative definition of what constitutes “narrow” versus “broad” in the literature. HGT SENTENCE. TALK ABOUT TRESEDER NUMBERS?</p>
<p>The activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition is a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(10, 11)</span>, however, and the activity peak of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> occurred with a corresponding decrease in <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance. Considering that <em>Agromyces</em> and certain <em>Bacteroidetes</em> types are likely soil predators one parsimonious hypothesis for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in abundance of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> is that the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders were consumed by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover yet intra-bacteria trophic interactions in soil C cycling models are rarely considered (e.g. <span class="citation">(12)</span>).</p>
<p>We propose two scenarios in the context of our results wherein C dynamics and fate would be affected by community composition. Genomic evidence shows cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait CITE Allison. Our study is the first to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose degradation <em>in situ</em> via DNA-SIP and our results are consistent with genomic evidence. Decreasing cellulose degraders would diminish cellulose decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Ecosystem function could be renewed by dispersed cellulose decomposers, however. For labile C decomposition, the absence fast growing spore formers would enable other microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization CITE. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and form spores. These distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may metabolize and allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics and fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover by predatory bacteria that feed on fast growing, spore forming labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal which would allow fast growing spore formers to continuously occupy the labile C decomposition niche even when washed out of an environment CITE. One proposed mechanism for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in community composition is that labile C can be used widely by microorganisms CITE. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process rates across different soils is that labile C degraders are easily dispersed. Notably, other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE Placella and many soil <em>Actinobacteria</em> form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but our results suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE may impact labile C dynamics and fate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(13)</span>. Labile C in our microcosms was assimilated by fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> phylotypes previously implicated as predators by have fed on the fast growing <em>Firmicutes</em>. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan <em>Spartobacteria</em> may degrade cellulose on a global scale, tropic interactions within bacteria are important for modeling soil C cycling, and functional guild diversity may be constrained by ecological strategies which can be more phylogenetically conserved than catabolic pathways.</p>
