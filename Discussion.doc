<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies drove early soil microbial ecology research. Historically important soil isolates included nine genera: <em>Agrobacterium</em>, <em>Alcaligenes</em>, <em>Arthrobacter</em>, <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Flavobacterium</em>, <em>Micromonospora</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Streptomyces</em> (<span class="citation">(1)</span> and reviewed by <span class="citation">(2)</span>) but culture-independent surveys of soil microbial diversity revealed soil can harbor 5,000 OTUs per half gram of soil <span class="citation">(3)</span> and that cultured isolates did not represent <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant genera. We recovered almost 6,000 OTUs in this study. Although culturing techniques can produce isolates from diverse soil phylogenetic lineages <span class="citation">(4)</span>, numerically dominant soil microorganisms are still uncultured and we know little of their ecophysiology <span class="citation">(2)</span>. In contrast, DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment. We found 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that can incorporate from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass. We also used DNA-SIP to assay substrate specificity and temporal dynamics of C-cycling or soluble and polymeric C degraders. Included in the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of numerically dominant yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>

<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was assimilated in succession by slower growing <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were either tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>

<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(5)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). We also observed how <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-substrate responsive OTUs changed in relative abundance with time in the microcosms and the abundance rank of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-substrate responsive OTUs in the bulk DNA. Ecological metrics show <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to of their high <em>rrn</em> gene copy number resulting in inflated relative abundance per genome. There are only faint ecological differences within the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs but the combination of <em>rrn</em> gene copy number, BD shift, abundance rank and relative abundance change over time is consistent with phylum membership (Figure RADVIZ). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTU <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA (Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting that fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>Ecological metrics suggest cellulose degraders are substrate specialists that grow slow and are in low bulk abundance. Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied perhaps because some <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs are generalists, grow faster and are more abundant when compared to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders vary in growth rate and while generally higher abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders can also be low abundance microorganisms. It’s not clear whether the observed activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition marks a trophic cascade or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations or both. Notably, each temporally defined response group clustered phylogenetically suggesting a uniform ecological strategy (Figure [fig:trees]). It’s also clear that some of the non-<em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are closely related to known predators (<em>Agromyces</em>) and many marine predatory bacteria are members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> (<span class="citation">(6)</span>). If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that there are many predatory soil bacteria that consume fast-growing, opportunistic, primary labile C assimilating, gram-positive spore-formers. Hence, trophic interactions among soil bacteria may be of importance in soil C turnover models.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire soil organic matter (SOM) influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous and often abundant soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are abundant microorganisms in many soil biomes and often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics.</p>
