<p>DNA-SIP can establish functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 soil OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass over time. With this information we can build a conceptual model for the soil food web with respect to xylose and cellulose in our microcosms. We propose xylose and cellulose C added to soil microcosms took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers first assimilated xylose C within 24 hours. Over the next 6 days, biomass from early-responding <em>Firmicutes</em> and the remaining xylose-C and was consumed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em>, and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria like <em>Cellvibrio</em> and members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups like <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, decomposed cellulose. Cellulose C incorporation into microbial biomass peaked at day 14 and extended through day 30.</p>

<p>Models of soil C cycling rely on functional niches defined by ecologists and ecological strategies such as growth rate and substrate specificity are parameters for functional niche behavior in soil C models <span class="citation">(1)</span>. Functional niches are commonly discovered by observing how community structure changes with changing conditions <span class="citation">Reference 2</span>. In this experiment, DNA-SIP revealed functional niche membership. We also used DNA-SIP data to quantify substrate specificity which is related to the magnitude of DNA BD shift upon <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeling (see Results). Moreover, we assessed growth rate of functional niche members by estimating niche member <em>rrn</em> gene copy number, a genomic feature reliably extrapolated from phylogeny that is indicative of how fast a microorganism grows <span class="citation">(3, 4)</span>. We found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs are slow growing substrate specialists relative to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]). We also found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into biomass at day one grow faster than OTUs that responded later (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]). If OTUs that first responded after day 1 consumed labeled OTUs that responded at day 1, this suggests that predators and/or saprophytes grow slower than microorganisms directly assimilating labile C and has implications for modelling trophic niches. We also note that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders are generally lower abundance members of the bulk community than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]), however, High <em>rrn</em> gene copy number may inflate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose-responder abundance.</p>
<p>NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering <span class="citation">(5)</span> and have been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil wet up <span class="citation">(6, 7)</span>. To our knowledge, assessing phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C- cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship between a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and its complexity has been noted previously <span class="citation">(8)</span> and the clade depth of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders, 0.028 16S rRNA gene sequence dissimilartiy, is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes for cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(9)</span>. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a readily horizontally transferred trait and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically, or, in this case may indicate that the overdispersed group includes more than one trait. It’s not clear which <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups. Temporally defined <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, however, are phylogenetically coherent (Figure [fig:tiledtree], Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]). For example, most day 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are members of the <em>Paenibacillus</em> (see Supplemental Note XX). Notably, <em>Paenibacillus</em> have been previously implicated as labile C decomposers <span class="citation">(10)</span>.</p>
<p>Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution of diagnostic genes across genomes <span class="citation">(9)</span> or from screening culture collections for a particular trait <span class="citation">(11)</span>. For instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon in microbial genomes is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms participate in glucose turnover <span class="citation">(12)</span>. <em>In situ</em> functional guild diversity, however, can vary significantly from diversity assessed by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution across genomes and more a function of lifestyle. Phenomena such as seasonal change <span class="citation">(13)</span>, and rainfall <span class="citation">(7)</span> pulse deliver nutrients and resources to soil. Therefore, fast growth and/or rapid resuscitation upon wet up <span class="citation">(7)</span> allow microorganisms to favorably compete for labile C resources. Life history ecological strategies tied to phylogeny like growth rate <span class="citation">Reference 2</span> may constrain the diversity of labile C assimilators even though the ability to use labile C is phylogenetically dispersed. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing <em>in situ</em> phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because DNA-SIP can account for life history strategies by targeting <em>active</em> microorganisms. Additionally, snapshot estimates of community composition commonly inform soil structure-function-relationship studies <span class="citation">(2)</span> but labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot community structure. Alternatively labile C decomposition might be linked specifically to community structure <em>dynamics</em>. That is, fast growing spore formers would not need to maintain high abundance to significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered resources. This accentuates the importance of DNA-SIP for describing soil ecology as DNA-SIP assesses activity which can be decoupled from snapshot abundance.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(12)</span> which in turn influences soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(14)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change with community composition <span class="citation">(12, 15)</span>. Aggregate biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation by a smaller suite of microbial participants <span class="citation">(12, 15)</span>. Within an aggregate process such as C decomposition, subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow <span class="citation">(12)</span>. In theory, “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds decompose labile and recalcitrant C, respectively <span class="citation">(12)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and recalcitrant C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also, it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria or saprophytes as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership – of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose – and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among microbial genomes than the ability to degrade cellulose, the number of unique active cellulose decomposer OTUs outnumbered the number of unique active xylose utilizers OTUs.</p>
<p>Trophic interactions and/or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations caused the activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to xylose addition. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(16, 17)</span>, and, in our microcosms <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> activity peaked while <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance plummeted (Figure [fig:l2fc], Figure [fig:rspndr<sub>c</sub>ounts], Figure [fig:babund]). Considering <em>Agromyces</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> phylotypes are likely soil predators, one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> abundance is that <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. Besides predation, mother cell lysis, the last step in sporulation, would release C from spore formers potentially to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, predatory bacteria or saprophytes consumed many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders. Hence, soil C cycling models should include trophic interactions between soil bacteria but rarely do (e.g. <span class="citation">(18)</span>). When soil C models do account for predators/saprophytes, trophic interactions are predicted to significantly influence c:N ratios of soil DOM relative to litter C:N, and, recycle significant amounts of microbial biomass <span class="citation">(1)</span>.</p>
<p>We propose two scenarios in the context of our results whereby community composition could affect C dynamics and fate. Genomic evidence shows cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait <span class="citation">(9)</span>. Our study evaluates the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose degradation in active microorganisms via DNA-SIP and genomic evidence concurs with our results. A decrease in cellulose degrader abundance would diminish cellulose decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Dispersed cellulose decomposers could renew ecosystem function, however. For labile C decomposition, the absence of fast growing spore formers would allow other microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and form spores and these distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may metabolize and allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics and fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover by predatory bacteria or saprophytes that feed on fast growing, spore forming labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal <span class="citation">(19)</span> which would allow fast growing spore formers to continuously occupy the labile C decomposition niche. One proposed mechanism for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in community composition is that labile C can be used widely by microorganisms <span class="citation">(12)</span>. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process rates across different soils is that labile C degraders disperse readily. Notably, other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="citation">(7)</span> and many soil <em>Actinobacteria</em> form hyphae that facilitate dispersal <span class="citation">(20)</span>. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but our results and previous studies suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal <em>Actinobacteria</em> may impact labile C dynamics and fate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(21)</span>. Fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers assimilated labile C in our microcosms. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> phylotypes, previously implicated as predators, may have fed on the fast growing <em>Firmicutes</em>. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan <em>Spartobacteria</em> may degrade cellulose on a global scale, bacterial tropic interactions can significantly impact soil C cycling, and life history ecological strategies such as fast growth constrain functional guild diversity for labile C decomposition.</p>
