<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology research but cultured isolates have not captured <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant genera <span class="citation">(1)</span>. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble and polymeric C degraders. Included in <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>

<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was assimilated in succession by slower growing <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were either tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>

<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(2)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). Ecological metrics suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to of their high <em>rrn</em> gene copy number resulting in inflated relative abundance per genome. There are only faint ecological differences within the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs but the combination of <em>rrn</em> gene copy number, BD shift, abundance rank and relative abundance change over time is consistent with phylum membership (Figure RADVIZ). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTU <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting that fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric ecological strategies perhaps because some <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes. It’s not clear whether the observed activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition marks a trophic cascade or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations or both. Notably, each temporally defined response group clustered phylogenetically suggesting a uniform ecological strategy (Figure [fig:trees]). It’s also clear that some of the non-<em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are closely related to known predators (<em>Agromyces</em>) and many marine predatory bacteria are members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> (<span class="citation">(3)</span>). Further, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as soil predatory bacteria <span class="citation">(4)</span>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that there are many predatory soil bacteria that consume fast-growing, opportunistic, primary labile C assimilating, gram-positive spore-formers. Hence, trophic interactions among soil bacteria may be of importance in soil C turnover models.</p>
<p>How – or if – phylogenetic composition affects SOM dynamics is an open question <span class="citation">(5)</span>. It is likely that the ability to carry out soil C transformations are redundant within and between soil microbial communities and that in the mineral soil abiotic factors are rate limiting <span class="citation">(5)</span>. Therefore, phylogenetic composition in mineral soil likely influences soil C fate as opposed to dynamics. We demonstrate a phylogenetically coherent response with time to soluble C additions – for instance, most of the initial response to xylose can be attributed to aerobic spore formers from few related genera. Assuming cellular resource allocation is consistent with phylogeny, it follows then that phylogenetic composition can significantly influence SOM fate. Polymeric C did not show the same phylogenetic coherence as soluble C decomposition in this study. This suggests that resource allocation among cellulose degraders would not have a single phylogenetic signal and the fate of polymeric C would not be similarly tied to phylogenetic composition.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire soil organic matter (SOM) influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil CITE. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics and fate. The largely phylogenetically coherent ecological groups observed in this study suggest that soil C fate is tied to phylogenetic composition.</p>
