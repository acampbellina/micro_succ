<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology research but cultured isolates have not captured <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant genera <span class="citation">(1)</span>. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble and polymeric C degraders. Included in <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="microbial-response-to-isotopic-labels">Microbial response to isotopic labels</h2>
<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was assimilated in succession by slower growing <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were either tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-soil-microorganisms-participating-in-the-decomposition-of-organic-matter">Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the decomposition of organic matter</h2>
<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(2)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). Ecological metrics suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher <em>rrn</em> gene copy number. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTU <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers. Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric C responder ecological strategies perhaps because <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes.</p>
<p>NRI values have been used to assess soil OTUs categorized by clustering relative abundance profiles in response to wet up (CITE Firestone and Wallenstein). Ecological groups defined by response to repeated wet up over XX weeks varied in phylogenetic clustering whereas groups defined by assessing relative abundance patterns within a single wet up event were largely phylogenetically clustered (CITE). We found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is tied to phylogeny. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be transferred between species and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically. Although, it’s not clear if most <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were all labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple groups.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(3)</span> which in turn can influence soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(4)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is an important step in predicting how biogeochemical process rates can change with community composition <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. We highlight three key results in our study with implications for models of soil C cycling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>labile and polymeric C decomposers functional guilds are similar in diversity,</p></li>
<li><p>labile C cycling may include significant trophic interactions, and</p></li>
<li><p>soil biomass does not respond <em>en masse</em> to C additions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Biogeochemical processes carried out by few taxa or “narrow” guilds are influenced more significantly by changes in community composition than processes carried out by greater numbers of taxa <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to be carried out by “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds, respectively <span class="citation">(3, 5)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Our results conflict with the established paradigm of decreasing diversity in guilds responsible transforming more recalcitrant C substrates. We found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49, and it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were largely clustered at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:tiledtree]) with <em>Proteobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders being an exception for both cellulose and xylose responders. When grouped at greater phylogenetic depth <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders can be distributed into a few clades (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). This suggests both cellulose and xylose decomposition are “narrow” processes.</p>
<p>The activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition marks a trophic cascade and/or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Further, the activity peak of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> occurred with a concomitant decrease in <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance. Considering that <em>Agromyces</em> and certain <em>Bacteroidetes</em> types are likely soil predators <span class="citation">(6, 7)</span> one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in abundance of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> is that the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders are consumed by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though intra-bacteria trophic interactions in soil C cycling are often not considered (e.g. <span class="citation">(8)</span>).</p>
<p>It has been proposed that incorporating soil microbial community structure into biogeochemical process models will improve predictions of global C fluxes in response to climate change <span class="citation">(3)</span> but first we need to understand the functional roles of soil microorganisms and the diversity of functional guilds. We demonstrate the soil functional guilds that participated in xylose and cellulose decomposition in our microcosms. These functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]). Of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose. Also, while we observed nearly 6,000 OTUs the number of conclusively active OTUs in xylose and cellulose decomposition were 49 and 63, respectively. Our results suggest that ecosystem C cycling models may need to assess parameters independently for C-cycling functional guilds as functional guilds are largely non-overlapping with respect to microbial membership and each functional guild represents a small fraction of overall soil microbial diversity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(9)</span>. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics and fate. The largely phylogenetically coherent ecological groups observed in this study suggest that soil C dynamics are tied to phylogenetic composition.</p>
