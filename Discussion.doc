<p>DNA-SIP can establish functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 soil OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these OTUs. We propose xylose and cellulose C added to soil microcosms took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers first assimilated labile C followed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes. The <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes may have also preyed on the rapidly responding <em>Firmicutes</em>. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> and members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups like <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, decomposed cellulose. Cellulose C incorporation into microbial biomass peaked at day 14 and was maintained through day 30.</p>

<p>We assessed <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTU ecological strategies by estimating each OTU’s <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and BD shift due to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with, and indicates, growth rate <span class="citation">(1, 2)</span>, whereas BD shift indicates substrate specificity (see Results). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance members of the bulk community than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). High <em>rrn</em> gene copy number may inflate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose-responder abundance. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs that incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into biomass at day one had greater <em>rrn</em> gene copy number than OTUs that responded later (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering <span class="citation">(3)</span> and have been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil wet up <span class="citation">(4, 5)</span>. To our knowledge, assessing phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C- cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship between a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously <span class="citation">(6)</span> and the clustering depth of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders, X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence, is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes for cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a readily horizontally transferred trait and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically, or, in this case may indicate that the group comprises more than one trait. It’s not clear which <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups. Temporally defined <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, however, are phylogenetically coherent (Figure [fug:tiledtree], Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]). For example, most day 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are members of the <em>Paenibacillus</em> (see Supplemental Note XX).</p>
<p>Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution of diagnostic genes across genomes CITE or from screening culture collections for a particular trait CITE. For instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon in microbial genomes is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms participate in glucose turnover CITE. <em>In situ</em> functional guild diversity, however, can vary significantly from diversity assessed by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution among genomes and more a function of lifestyle. Seasonal change CITE, land management CITE, and rainfall CITE pulse deliver nutrients and resources to soil. Therefore, fast growth and/or rapid resuscitation upon wet up CITE allow microorganisms to favorably compete for labile C resources. Life history determines growth rate and dessication resistance whereas the ability to use labile C is phylogenetically dispersed so life history may constrain the diversity of labile C assimilators. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing <em>in situ</em> phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because DNA-SIP can account for life history strategies by targeting active microorganisms. Additionally, snapshot estimates of community composition commonly inform soil structure-function-relationship studies CITE Fierer but labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot community structure, but alternatively to community structure <em>dynamics</em>. Fast growing spore formers would not need to maintain high abundance to significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered resources. This accentuates the usefulness of DNA-SIP for describing soil ecology as DNA-SIP assesses activity which can be decoupled from snapshot abundance.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(8)</span> which in turn influences soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(9)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change with community composition <span class="citation">(8, 10)</span>. Aggregate biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation by a smaller suite of microbial participants <span class="citation">(8, 10)</span>. Within an aggregate process such as C decomposition, subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow <span class="citation">(8)</span>. In theory, “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds decompose labile and recalcitrant C, respectively <span class="citation">(8)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also, it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership – of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose – and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure [fig:genspec]). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among microbial genomes than the ability to degrade cellulose, active cellulose decomposers outnumbered active xylose utilizers.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders largely clustered near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI <span class="math"> &gt; </span> 0) at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). Therefore, <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders distribute into fewer clades than OTUs (Figure [fig:tiledtree]). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders formed clades at X.XX sequence divergence (consenTrait) while our OTUs were established at 0.03 sequence divergence.</p>
<p>Trophic interactions or the functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations caused the activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to xylose addition. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(11, 12)</span>, and, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> activity peaked while <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance decreased in our microcosms. Considering <em>Agromyces</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> phylotypes are likely soil predators, one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> abundance is that <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions predatory bacteria consumed, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders. Hence, soil C cycling models should include predatory interactions between soil bacteria but rarely do (e.g. <span class="citation">(13)</span>).</p>
<p>We propose two scenarios in the context of our results whereby community composition could affect C dynamics and fate. Genomic evidence shows cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait CITE Allison. Our study evaluates the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose degradation in active microorganisms via DNA-SIP and genomic evidence concurs with our results. A decrease in cellulose degraders abundance would diminish cellulose decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Dispersed cellulose decomposers could renew ecosystem function, however. For labile C decomposition, the absence fast growing spore formers would allow other microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization CITE. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and form spores and these distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may metabolize and allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics and fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover by predatory bacteria that feed on fast growing, spore forming labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal which would allow fast growing spore formers to continuously occupy the labile C decomposition niche CITE. One proposed mechanism for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in community composition is that labile C can be used widely by microorganisms CITE. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process rates across different soils is that labile C degraders disperse readily. Notably, other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE Placella and many soil <em>Actinobacteria</em> form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but our results suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal <em>Actinobacteria</em> CITE may impact labile C dynamics and fate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(14)</span>. Fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers assimilated labile C in our microcosms. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> phylotypes, previously implicated as predators, may have fed on the fast growing <em>Firmicutes</em>. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan <em>Spartobacteria</em> may degrade cellulose on a global scale, bacterial tropic interactions can significantly impact soil C cycling, and life history constrains functional guild diversity for labile C decomposition.</p>
