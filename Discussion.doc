<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology research but cultured isolates have not captured <em>in situ</em> numerically abundant genera <span class="citation">(1)</span>. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble and polymeric C degraders. Included in <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Chloroflexi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="microbial-response-to-isotopic-labels">Microbial response to isotopic labels</h2>
<p>We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure [fig:foodweb]): First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was assimilated in succession by slower growing <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes that were either tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as <em>Cellvibrio</em> degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, were also significant contributors to cellulose decomposition.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-soil-microorganisms-participating-in-the-decomposition-of-organic-matter">Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the decomposition of organic matter</h2>
<p>We assessed the ecology of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs by estimating the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU. <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate <span class="citation">(2)</span> and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see results). Ecological metrics suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow slower (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]), have greater substrate specificity (Figure [fig:shift]), and are generally lower abundance than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure [fig:shift]). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher <em>rrn</em> gene copy number. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTU <em>rrn</em> gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA (Figure [fig:shift], Figure [fig:copy]) suggesting fast-growing microbes assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose before slow growers.</p>
<p>Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric ecological strategies perhaps because <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes. It’s not clear whether the observed activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition marks a trophic cascade or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations or both. Notably, each temporally defined response group clustered phylogenetically suggesting a uniform ecological strategy (Figure [fig:trees]). It’s also clear that some of the non-<em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are closely related to known predators (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(3)</span>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that there are many predatory soil bacteria that consume fast-growing, aerobic spore-formers. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil community composition CITE which in turn can influence biogeochemical process rates CITE. Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is an important step in predicting how biogeochemical process rates can change with community composition CITE. We highlight three key results in our study with implications for soil C cycling models: (1) labile and polymeric C decomposers may have similar within group phylogenetic breadth, (2) soil biomass does not respond <em>en masse</em> to C additions, and (3) trophic interactions among soil bacteria may greatly influence soil C fate.</p>
<p>It is assumed that transformations carried out by functional guilds of ”narrow” phylogenetic breadth can be influenced more significantly by compositional change than processes carried out by a large number of taxa (CITE Tresseder, Schimel). ”Narrow” processes are thought to include nitrogen transformations such as nitrogen fixation and denitrification, and recalcitrant C decomposition (CITE). Labile C is considered a ”broad” process comparatively (CITE), however, the phylogenetic breadth of active labile C and recalcitrant C decomposers in soil has not been observed directly. Our results are in conflict with the established paradigm that labile C degradation is a ”broader” process than recalcitrant C degradation. In fact, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Further, both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were largely clustered at taxonomic levels broader than the OTUs established in this study (Figure [fig:trees]) with <em>Proteobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders being a possible exception for cellulose and xylose. The phylogenetic clustering of substrate response suggests that both cellulose and xylose decomposition are ”narrow” processes as opposed to ”broad” and if follows that labile C dynamics in soil may be influenced similarly in magnitude to recalcitrant C dynamics in response to changes in community composition.</p>
<p>“However, most process-based models that incorporate microbes are based on simple microbial parameters or functions”</p>
<p>Biogeochemical process models are the specific mechanism by which process rates are predicted. Biogeochemical models of soil C cycling, however, often treat soil biomass with simple and few parameters CITE.</p>
<p>Trophic interactions in soil C cycling are often modelled at the taxonomic level of domain CITE. That is, models have considered C cycling between bacteria and protists (CITE), for example, but not C cycling between among bacteria. We observed a cascade in activity with xylose additions that suggests significant trophic interactions among soil bacteria. Although we cannot be sure the temporal nature of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose response observed in our study can be attributed to predatory interactions, we note that the activity peak of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> occurred with a concomitant decrease in <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance. Considering that <em>Agromyces</em> and certain <em>Bacteroidetes</em> types are likely soil predators (CITE) one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in abundance of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> is that the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>.</p>
<p>“We conclude that predicting the influence of declining species diversity on trophic-level dynamics and ecosystem processes is difficult, at least in food webs with a small initial number of species, unless the characteristics of species and the nature of their interactions are known.”</p>
<p>“Research questions of the highest urgency are the assignment of species to functional groups and determining the redundancy of species within functional groups”</p>
<p>“These priorities follow from the need to address the extent of any loss of functioning in soils, associated with intensive agriculture, forest disturbance, pollution of the environment, and global environmental change.”</p>
<p>“The soil biota considered at present to be most at risk are species-poor functional groups among macrofaunal shredders of organic matter, bioturbators of soil, specialized bacteria like nitrifiers and nitrogen fixers, and fungiforming mycorrhizas”</p>
<p>Key results:</p>
<p>Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, for instance</p>
<p>narrow versus broad processes, labile versus recalcitrant carbon</p>
<p>trophic levels are inter-domain or implied as such</p>
<p>(1) diversity of functional groups – species poor, narrow processes</p>
<p>(2) predators</p>
<p>(3) different types for different substrates, not en masse</p>
<p>Three findings are particularly notable: (1) soil microbes that use cellulose are largely different than those that use xylose (Figure [fig:ord]), (2) C from labile sources passes through phylogenetically coherent groups in succession (Figure XX), and, (3) a small subset of the total suite of soil microbes used cellulose or xylose in our microcosms. Our findings imply that environmental perturbation can affect decomposition of C substrates in different ways, phylogenetically coherent groups of predators may feed on opportunistic microbes that grow on labile C, and that the diversity of soil microorganisms does not respond <em>en masse</em> to C input. Predicting how environmental changes will influence ecosystem processes such as cellulose decomposition will require studies to assess what mechanisms – biotic or otherwise – are rate limiting, how different microbes allocate C resources, which microorganisms participate in specific C transformations, and whether a few key taxa or complementary, diverse assemblages participate in the process. Here, we focus on the diversity and identities within functional guilds of C-cycling soil microbes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire soil organic matter (SOM) influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil CITE. Our results also suggest that members of the <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics and fate. The largely phylogenetically coherent ecological groups observed in this study suggest that soil C dynamics are tied to phylogenetic composition.</p>
