\section{Discussion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil 
Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology
research but cultured isolates have not captured \textit{in situ} numerically
abundant genera \citep{Janssen2006}. DNA-SIP can
characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single
experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil
that incorporated $^{13}$C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and
characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble
and polymeric C degraders. Included in $^{13}$C-xylose and
$^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet
functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as
\textit{Verrucomicrobia}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Chloroflexi}.

\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic
\textit{Firmicutes} spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was
assimilated in succession by slower growing \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria} phylotypes that were either
tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g.
\textit{Agromyces}), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from
polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical
cellulose degrading bacteria such as \textit{Cellvibrio} degraded cellulose
but uncharacterized lineages in the \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, specifically the
\textit{Spartobacteria}, were also significant contributors to cellulose
decomposition.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed the ecology of $^{13}$C-responsive OTUs by estimating the
\textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). Ecological metrics predict $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance than
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The higher abundance
of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher \textit{rrn} gene copy
number. $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTU \textit{rrn} gene copy number correlated
inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate
$^{13}$C into DNA (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting
fast-growing microbes assimilated $^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers.
Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric
C responder ecological strategies perhaps because $^{13}$C labeled
microorganisms did not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via
predatory interactions and/or are saprophytes. 

% Fakesubsubsection:NRI values have been used to assess
NRI values are useful metrics to probe evolution-ecology relationships and have
recently been used to assess soil OTUs categorized by their response to wet up
(CITE Firestone and Wallenstein). Ecological groups defined in a long term
repeated wet up experiment over XX weeks varied in phylogenetic clustering
whereas groups defined by assessing relative abundance patterns within a single
wet up event were largely phylogenetically clustered (CITE). To our knowledge
clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP
incubations has not been attempted. We found that cellulose and xylose
responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that
the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly
reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive
relationship with a physiological trait's phylogenetic depth and complexity has
been noted previously (CITE Martiny) and the $^{13}$C-cellulose response trait
depth observed in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the
same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic
enzymes in cellulose degradation (CITE). Overdispersion, as we saw for the
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be
transferred between species and/or a trait that is broadly distributed
phylogenetically. It's not clear, though, if all $^{13}$C-xylose responsive
organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below),
and therefore it's not clear if $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs in this
experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple groups
in a trophic cascade. 

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil
community composition \citep{McGuire2010} which in turn can influence soil
biogeochemical process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing
functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group
members is an important step in predicting how biogeochemical process rates can
change with community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. 
%We highlight three key results in our study with implications for models of
%soil C cycling: \begin{itemize} \item labile and polymeric C decomposers
%functional guilds are similar in diversity, \item labile C cycling may include
%significant trophic interactions, and \item soil biomass is a heterogeneous
%mixture of ecological groups that respond as temporally cohesive units
%\end{itemize}
Biogeochemical processes carried out by few taxa or ``narrow'' guilds are
influenced more significantly by changes in community composition than
processes carried out by greater numbers of taxa
\citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are
considered to be carried out by ``broad'' and ``narrow'' functional guilds,
respectively \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. However, the diversity of active
labile C and insoluble, polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly
quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose, 63,
than $^{13}$C-xylose, 49. Also it is possible that many $^{13}$C-xylose
responders are predatory bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see
below). The cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were
non-overlapping in membership and represented a small fraction of total soil
community diversity (Figure~\ref{fig:genspec}); of 104 $^{13}$C-responders only
8 responded to both cellulose and xylose. Interestingly, while xylose use is
undoubtedly more widely distributed among global microorganisms than the
ability to degrade cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our
microcosms was not greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.

% Fakesubsubsection:Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose
Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose responders were largely clustered
near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI $>$ 0) at taxonomic levels broader
than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). When
grouped at greater phylogenetic depth $^{13}$C-responders can be distributed
into even fewer clades than OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). This suggests
\textit{active} cellulose and xylose responder groups were ``narrow'' in that
few lineages relative to total observed lineages were active participants in
cellulose or xylose decomposition. 

% Fakesubsubsection:We propose two scenarios for how changes
We propose two scenarios for how changes in community composition can affect
C cycling based on our study. For cellulose decomposition, our results suggest
that cellulose degradation is a conserved and narrowly distributed trait
\textit{in situ}. Therefore, changes in community composition could greatly
reduce the number of microorganisms capable of cellulose degradation and reduce
cellulose decomposition process rates. For xylose, on the other hand, community
shifts might not change the number of xylose decomposers. Rather, since we
observed phylogenetically and ecologically coherent groups respond to
$^{13}$C-xylose within time points, changes in soil community composition might
elicit wholesale shifts primary xylose decomposers from one phylogenetic group
to another. Process rates may not change if the number of xylose decomposers is
rate limiting, but, different and phylogenetically coherent groups of xylose
decomposers may differently allocate C resources and precipitate a different
trophic cascade thus influencing soil C fate if not dynamics. 

% Fakesubsubsection:It's not clear whether the observed activity
The activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition is
a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation of functional groups tuned to
different resource concentrations. \textit{Actinobacteria} (e.g.
\textit{Agromyces}) and \textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously implicated
as predatory soil bacteria \citep{Lueders2006,16346402}. Further, the activity
peak of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} occurred with
a concomitant decrease in \textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose responder
relative abundance. Considering that \textit{Agromyces} and certain
\textit{Bacteroidetes} types are likely soil predators  one parsimonious
hypothesis for $^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} with a corresponding decrease in abundance of
$^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes} is that the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} fed on the $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. If the
temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic
interactions, our results suggest that many, if not most, fast-growing labile
C degraders are consumed by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions
between soil bacteria may be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though
intra-bacteria trophic interactions in soil C cycling are rarely if ever
considered (e.g. \citep{Moore1988}).

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate
change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out
specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from
uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose
decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}),
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}.
\textit{Spartobacteria} in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil
microorganisms and are often the most abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia}
order in soil \citep{Bergmann_2011}. Our results also suggest that
members of the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} act in
the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as
predators. NEEDS A FINAL SENTENCE.
