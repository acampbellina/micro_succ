\section{Discussion} 
\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
DNA-SIP can establish functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single
experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 soil OTUs that incorporated
$^{13}$C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass over time. With this
information we can build a conceptual model for the soil food web with respect
to xylose and cellulose in our microcosms. We propose xylose and
cellulose-C added to soil microcosms took the following path through the
microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}): fast-growing \textit{Firmicutes}
spore formers first assimilated xylose C within 24 hours. Over the next
6 days, biomass from early-responding \textit{Firmicutes} and the remaining
xylose-C and  was consumed by \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria}, and \textit{Proteobacteria} phylotypes. Canonical
cellulose degrading bacteria like \textit{Cellvibrio} and members of
cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups like
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia},
specifically the \textit{Spartobacteria}, decomposed cellulose. Cellulose
C incorporation into microbial biomass peaked at day 14 and extended through
day 30.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:Models of soil C cycling rely on
Models of soil C cycling rely on functional niches defined by soil
microbiologists. In these models ecological strategies such as growth rate and
substrate specificity are parameters for functional niche behavior
\citep{Kaiser2014a}. Functional niches are commonly discovered by observing how
community structure changes with changing conditions
\cite{Fierer2007}. In this experiment, DNA-SIP revealed functional niche
membership. We also used DNA-SIP data to quantify substrate specificity which
is related to the magnitude of DNA BD shift upon $^{13}$C labeling (see
Results). Moreover, we assessed growth rate of functional niche members by
estimating niche member \textit{rrn} gene copy number, a genomic feature
reliably extrapolated from phylogeny that is indicative of how fast
a microorganism grows \citep{11125085,Kembel_2012}. We found that
$^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs are likely slow growing substrate
specialists relative to $^{13}$C-xylose responders (Figure~\ref{fig:shift},
Figure~\ref{fig:copy}). We also found that $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs that
incorporated $^{13}$C into biomass at day one grow faster than OTUs that
responded later (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}). If OTUs that
first responded after day 1 consumed labeled OTUs that responded at day 1, this
suggests that predators and/or saprophytes grow slower than microorganisms
directly assimilating labile C and has implications for modelling trophic
niches. We also note that $^{13}$C-cellulose responders are generally lower
abundance members of the bulk community than $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), however, high \textit{rrn} gene copy number may
inflate $^{13}$C-xylose-responder abundance.

% Fakesubsubsection:NRI values have been used to assess
NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering \citep{Webb2000} and have 
been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil
wet up \citep{Evans2014a,Placella2012}. To our knowledge, assessing
phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into
biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that $^{13}$C-
cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively.
This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically
conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation
biochemistry. The positive relationship between a physiological trait's
phylogenetic depth and its complexity has been noted previously
\citep{Martiny2013a} and the clade depth of $^{13}$C-cellulose responders,
0.028 16S rRNA gene sequence dissimilartiy, is on the same order as that
observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes for cellulose
degradation \citep{Berlemont2013}. Overdispersion, as we saw for the
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a readily horizontally
transferred trait and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically,
or, in this case may indicate that the overdispersed group includes more than
one trait. It's not clear which $^{13}$C-xylose responsive organisms were
labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore
it's not clear if $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute
a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups.
Temporally defined $^{13}$C-xylose responder groups, however, were
phylogenetically coherent (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree},
Figure~\ref{fig:xyl_count}). For example, most day
1 $^{13}$C-xylose responders are members of the \textit{Paenibacillus} (see
Supplemental~Note~XX). Notably, \textit{Paenibacillus} have been previously
implicated as labile C decomposers \citep{Verastegui_2014}.

% Fakesubsubsection:Intuitively C cycling trait diversity is inferred
Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution
of diagnostic genes across genomes \citep{Berlemont2013} or from screening
culture collections for a particular trait \citep{Martiny2013}. For
instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon in microbial
genomes is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms
participate in glucose turnover \citep{McGuire2010}. \textit{In situ}
functional guild diversity, however, can vary significantly from diversity
assessed by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil,
for instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution across
genomes and more a function of lifestyle. Phenomena such as seasonal change
\citep{Schmidt2007}, and rainfall \citep{Placella2012} cause nutrient and
resource concentrations in soil to fluctuate. Therefore, fast growth and/or
rapid resuscitation upon wet up \citep{Placella2012} allow microorganisms to
favorably compete for labile C resources. Life history ecological strategies
tied to phylogeny like growth rate \cite{Fierer2007} may constrain the
diversity of labile C assimilators even though the ability to use labile C is
phylogenetically dispersed. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing \textit{in situ}
phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because DNA-SIP can
account for life history strategies by targeting \textit{active}
microorganisms. Additionally, snapshot estimates of community composition
commonly inform soil-structure-function-relationship studies \citep{Fierer2007}
but labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot community structure.
Alternatively labile C decomposition might be linked specifically to community
structure \textit{dynamics}. That is, fast growing spore formers would not need
to maintain high abundance to significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered
resources. This accentuates the importance of DNA-SIP for describing soil
ecology as DNA-SIP assesses activity which can be decoupled from snapshot
abundance.

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil
community composition \citep{McGuire2010} which in turn influences soil
biogeochemical process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing
functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group
members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change
with community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. Aggregate
biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses involve a broad
array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than
narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation by
a narrow suite of microbial participants \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}.
Within an aggregate process such as C decomposition, subprocesses can be
further classified as broad or narrow \citep{McGuire2010}. In theory, ``broad''
and ``narrow'' functional guilds decompose labile and recalcitrant C,
respectively \citep{McGuire2010}. However, the diversity of active labile C and
recalcitrant C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably,
we found more OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose, 63, than $^{13}$C-xylose,
49. Also, it is possible that many $^{13}$C-xylose responders are predatory
bacteria or saprophytes as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below).
Cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in
membership -- of
104 $^{13}$C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose -- and
represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity
(Figure~\ref{fig:genspec}). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely
distributed among microbial genomes than the ability to degrade cellulose, the
number of unique active cellulose decomposer OTUs outnumbered the number of
unique active xylose utilizer OTUs.

% Fakesubsubsection:Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose
%Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose responders largely clustered
%near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI $>$ 0) at taxonomic levels broader
%than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}).
%Therefore, $^{13}$C-responders distribute into fewer clades than OTUs
%(Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). 

% Fakesubsubsection:Trophic interactions and/or functional groups
Trophic interactions and/or functional groups tuned to different resource
concentrations caused the activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to
xylose addition. \textit{Actinobacteria} (e.g. \textit{Agromyces}) and
\textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously implicated as predatory soil
bacteria \citep{Lueders2006,16346402}, and,  in our microcosms
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} activity peaked  while
\textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose responder relative abundance plummeted
(Figure~\ref{fig:l2fc}, Figure~\ref{fig:xyl_count},
Figure~\ref{fig:babund}). Considering \textit{Agromyces} and
\textit{Bacteroidetes} phylotypes are likely soil predators, one parsimonious
hypothesis for $^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} with a corresponding decrease in $^{13}$C-labeled
\textit{Firmicutes} abundance is that \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} fed on $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. Besides
predation, mother cell lysis, the last step in sporulation, would release
C from spore formers potentially to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria}. If the temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose
incorporation are due to trophic interactions, predatory bacteria or
saprophytes consumed many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders. Hence,
soil C cycling models should include trophic interactions between soil bacteria
but rarely do (e.g. \citep{Moore1988}). When soil C models do account for
predators/saprophytes, trophic interactions are predicted to significantly
influence C:N ratios of SOM relative to litter C:N, and, recycle significant
amounts of microbial biomass \citep{Kaiser2014a}.

% Fakesubsubsection:We propose two scenarios whereby community
We propose two scenarios in the context of our results whereby community
composition could affect C dynamics and fate. Genomic evidence shows cellulose
degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait \citep{Berlemont2013}. Our
study evaluates the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose degradation in
active microorganisms via DNA-SIP and our results concur with genomic
evidence. A decrease in cellulose degrader abundance would diminish
cellulose decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the
phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Dispersed cellulose
decomposers could renew ecosystem function, however. For labile
C decomposition, the absence of fast growing spore formers would allow other
microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid
recolonization. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and form
spores and these distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct C use
dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may metabolize and
allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics and fate.
Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover by
predatory bacteria or saprophytes that feed on fast growing, spore forming
labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal
\citep{Nicholson2000} which would allow fast growing spore formers to
continuously occupy the labile C decomposition niche. One proposed mechanism
for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in community
composition is that labile C is decomposed by a diverse suite of soil
microorganisms \citep{McGuire2010}. An alternative hypothesis for consistent
labile C process rates across different soils is that labile C degraders
disperse readily. Notably, other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover
include members of the \textit{Actinobacteria} \citep{Placella2012} and many
soil \textit{Actinobacteria} form hyphae that facilitate dispersal
\citep{KILLHAM2007}. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but our
results and previous studies suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable
to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal
\textit{Actinobacteria} may impact labile C dynamics and fate.

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate
change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out
specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from
physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in
cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}), \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}. \textit{Spartobacteria} in
particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most
abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia} order in soil \citep{Bergmann_2011}.
Fast-growing \textit{Firmicutes} spore formers assimilated labile C in our
microcosms. \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} phylotypes,
previously implicated as predators, may have fed on the fast growing
\textit{Firmicutes}. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan
\textit{Spartobacteria} may degrade cellulose on a global scale, bacterial
tropic interactions can significantly impact soil C cycling, and life history
ecological strategies such as fast growth  constrain functional guild
diversity for labile C decomposition.
