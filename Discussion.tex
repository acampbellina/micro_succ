\section{Discussion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil 
Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology
research but cultured isolates have not captured \textit{in situ} numerically
abundant genera \citep{Janssen2006}. DNA-SIP can
characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single
experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil
that incorporated $^{13}$C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and
characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble
and polymeric C degraders. Included in $^{13}$C-xylose and
$^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet
functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as
\textit{Verrucomicrobia}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Chloroflexi}.

\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic
\textit{Firmicutes} spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was
assimilated in succession by slower growing \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria} phylotypes that were either
tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g.
\textit{Agromyces}), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from
polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical
cellulose degrading bacteria such as \textit{Cellvibrio} degraded cellulose
but uncharacterized lineages in the \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, specifically the
\textit{Spartobacteria}, were also significant contributors to cellulose
decomposition.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed the ecology of $^{13}$C-responsive OTUs by estimating the
\textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). Ecological metrics suggest $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance than
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The higher abundance
of xylose responders may also be in part due to higher \textit{rrn} gene copy
number. $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTU \textit{rrn} gene copy number correlated
inversely with the time at which the OTU was first found to incorporate
$^{13}$C into DNA (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting
fast-growing microbes assimilated $^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers.
Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric
ecological strategies perhaps because $^{13}$C labeled microorganisms did not
primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions
and/or are saprophytes. 

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil
community composition CITE which in turn can influence soil biogeochemical
process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing functional group
diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is an
important step in predicting how biogeochemical process rates can change with
community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. We highlight three key
results in our study with implications for models of soil C cycling:
\begin{itemize} \item labile and polymeric C decomposers are similar in
phylogenetic breadth, \item labile C cycling may include significant trophic
interactions, and \item soil biomass does not respond \textit{en masse} to
C additions.\end{itemize}

% Fakesubsubsection:Transformations carried out
Transformations carried out by functional guilds of "narrow" phylogenetic
breadth are influenced more significantly by changes in community composition
than processes carried out by greater numbers of taxa
\citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are
considered to be carried out by "broad" and "narrow" functional
guilds,respectively \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. However, the phylogenetic
breadth of active labile C and recalcitrant C decomposers in soil has not been
directly quantified. Our results conflict with the established
paradigm of decreasing diversity in guilds responsible transforming more
recalcitrant C substrates (see CITE). We found more OTUs responded to
$^{13}$C-cellulose, 63, than $^{13}$C-xylose, 49. Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and
$^{13}$C-xylose responders were largely clustered at taxonomic levels broader
than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:trees}) with
\textit{Proteobacteria} $^{13}$C-responders being an exception for both
cellulose and xylose responders. When grouped at greater phylogenetic depth
$^{13}$C-responders can be distributed into a few clades. This suggests both
cellulose and xylose decomposition are "narrow" processes as opposed to
"broad". It follows, therefore, that labile C dynamics in soil may be
influenced similarly to recalcitrant C dynamics in response to changes in soil
community composition. 

% Fakesubsubsection:It's not clear whether the observed activity
The activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition marks
a trophic cascade and/or functional groups tuned to different resource
concentrations. \textit{Actinobacteria} (e.g. \textit{Agromyces}) and
\textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously implicated as predatory soil
bacteria \citep{Lueders2006}. Further, the activity peak of
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} occurred with a concomitant
decrease in \textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose responder relative abundance.
Considering that \textit{Agromyces} and certain \textit{Bacteroidetes} types
are likely soil predators (CITE) one parsimonious hypothesis for
$^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} with
a corresponding decrease in abundance of $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}
is that the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} fed on the
$^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. If the temporal dynamics of
$^{13}$C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results
suggest that many if not most fast-growing labile C degraders are consumed by
predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may be
of importance for modelling soil C turnover. Trophic interactions in soil
C cycling are often modelled at the taxonomic level of domain CITE. That is,
models have considered C cycling between bacteria and protists (CITE), for
example, but not C cycling between among bacteria.

% Fakesubsubsection:Biogeochemical process models are the specific mechanism
It has been proposed that incorporating more complex models of soil biomass
C cycling will improve predictions of C dynamics at the ecosystem scale (CITE).
Before building C cycling models for soil microorganisms we need to map how
C moves through the soil microbial community. In this study we demonstrate soil
guilds participating in xylose and cellulose decomposition. These
functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and represented a small
fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure~XX). Of XXX
$^{13}$C-responders only XX responded to both cellulose and xylose. Also, while
we observed nearly 6,000 OTUs, the number of conclusively active OTUs in
a given C transformation was two orders of magnitude fewer. Modelling
C dynamics within soil communities, therefore, may need to treat functional
guilds independently and should consider that soil biomass does not act
\textit{en masse}.

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire soil organic
matter (SOM) influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not
know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In
this experiment microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages
participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included
members of the \textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}),
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}.
\textit{Spartobacteria} in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil
microorganisms and are often the most abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia}
order in soil CITE. Our results also suggest that members of the
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} act in the cascade of
labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both
points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics and fate. The largely
phylogenetically coherent ecological groups observed in this study suggest that
soil C dynamics are tied to phylogenetic composition.
