\section{Discussion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil 
Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology
research but culturing has not captured \textit{in situ} numerically abundant
soil genera \citep{Janssen2006}. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for
thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We
identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated $^{13}$C from
xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity
and C-cycling dynamics for these OTUs. $^{13}$C-xylose and $^{13}$C-cellulose
responsive OTUs included members of cosmopolitan yet functionally
uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as \textit{Verrucomicrobia},
\textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Chloroflexi}.

\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
Labile C such as xylose was first assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic
\textit{Firmicutes} aerobic spore formers. The remaining labile C biomass
C from growing \textit{Firmicutes} was assimilated in succession by 
\textit{Bacteroidetes}, \textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria}
phylotypes that were tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were
predatory bacteria (e.g. \textit{Agromyces}), and/or were specialized for
consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates was decomposed by bacteria
after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as
\textit{Cellvibrio} degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia},
specifically the \textit{Spartobacteria}, were also significant contributors to
cellulose decomposition.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed the ecology of $^{13}$C-responsive OTUs by estimating each OTU's
the \textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon $^{13}$C-labeling.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). Ecological metrics predict $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance members
of the bulk community than $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be
in part due to higher \textit{rrn} gene copy number. $^{13}$C-xylose responsive
OTUs that responded beginning at day 3 had greater \textit{rrn} gene copy
number than OTUs that responded to $^{13}$C-xylose later
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting fast-growing
microbes assimilated $^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers. 

% Fakesubsubsection:NRI values have been used to assess
NRI values are useful metrics for assessing phylogenetic clustering
\citep{Webb2000} and have recently been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs
categorized by response to wet up \citep{Evans2014a,Placella2012}. To our
knowledge assessing the phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate
heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We
found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed,
respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is
phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose
degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship with a physiological
trait's phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously
\citep{Martiny2013a} and the $^{13}$C-cellulose response trait depth observed
in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as
that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in
cellulose degradation \citep{Berlemont2013}. Overdispersion, as we saw for the
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be
transferred between species via horizontal gene transfer and/or a trait that is
broadly distributed phylogenetically. It's not clear, though, if all
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose
assimilation (see below), and therefore it's not clear if $^{13}$C-xylose
responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful
group or multiple ecological groups. 

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil
community composition \citep{McGuire2010} which in turn can influence soil
biogeochemical process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing
functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group
members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates can change
with community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. 
Biogeochemical processes that are the aggregate of many subprocesses such as
soil respiration involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less
influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single,
specific chemical transformation and a smaller suite of microbial participants
\citep{Schimel_1995}. Within an aggregate process such as decomposition,
subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow processes
\citep{McGuire2010}. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to
be carried out by ``broad'' and ``narrow'' functional guilds, respectively
\citep{McGuire2010}. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble,
polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we
found more OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose, 63, than $^{13}$C-xylose, 49.
Also, it is possible that many $^{13}$C-xylose responders are predatory
bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). The cellulose
and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and
represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity
(Figure~\ref{fig:genspec}); of 104 $^{13}$C-responders only 8 responded to both
cellulose and xylose. Interestingly, while xylose use is undoubtedly more
widely distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade
cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not
greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.

% Fakesubsubsection:Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose
Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose responders were largely clustered
near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI $>$ 0) at taxonomic levels broader
than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). Therefore
$^{13}$C-responders can be distributed into even fewer clades than number of
OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). The consenTRAIT estimate for the breadth of
the xylose use trait is X.XX, for instance, while our OTUs were established at
0.03 sequence identity divergence. \textit{Active} cellulose and xylose
responder groups were ``narrow'' in that few lineages relative to total
observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose
decomposition but there is not working quantitative definition of what
constitutes ``narrow'' versus ``broad'' in the literature. HGT SENTENCE.

% Fakesubsubsection:For community composition to influence ecological processes
For community composition to influence ecological processes several criteria
must be satisfied CITE Schimel 2012: microorganisms must differ in functional
capacity, and biological reactions must influence C fate or be rate limiting.
We demonstrate that the microbes participating in cellulose decomposition are
largely different than those participating in xylose decomposition which
satisfies the first criterion above. The other criteria were not directly
tested in our study but we propose several mechanisms suggested by our results
wherein C dynamics and fate would be affected by community composition. Genomic
evidence shows cellulose degradation is likely a conserved trait CITE Allison.
To our knowledge this study is the first to evaluate the phylogenetic
conservation of cellulose degradation \textit{in situ} via DNA-SIP and our
results are remarkably consistent with genomic evidence. A decrease in active
cellulose degraders could decrease cellulose decomposition process rates as the
phylogenetic conservation of cellulose degradation likely means few soil
microorganisms can fill the cellulose degradation niche. If cellulose
decomposers are readily dispersed, however, dispersed microorganisms could fill
the cellulose degradation void renewing ecosystem function. For labile
C decomposition, if dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization CITE,
a decrease in fast growing spore former abundance could enable the labile
C degradation niche to be occupied by different labile C degraders. The primary
labile C degraders in this study were fast growers, and have a distinct
lifestyle (spore formation) which might indicate a distinct C use dynamics
and/or resource allocation signature. Both attributes are unlikely to be
mimicked by substitution with a different functional group and thus this
substitution might influence labile C dynamics and fate. Further, it is unclear
how labile C degrader substitution would affect biomass C turnover by predatory
bacteria that appeared to feed on fast growing, spore forming labile
C decomposers. Spore formation, however, might enable dispersal. The
consistency of labile C decomposition rates across soils is hypothesized to be
a manifestation of the wide ability to use labile materials across
microorganisms CITE. An alternative hypothesis is that labile C degraders are
easily dispersed. Other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include
members of the \textit{Actinobacteria} CITE Placella and Many soil
\textit{Actinobacteria} form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two
hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, however, but our results suggest that
environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or
quickly resusitated, hyphal \textit{Actinobacteria} CITE may impact labile
C dynamics and fate.

% Fakesubsubsection:It's not clear whether the observed activity
The activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition is
a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation of the activity of functional
groups tuned to different resource concentrations. \textit{Actinobacteria}
(e.g. \textit{Agromyces}) and \textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously
implicated as predatory soil bacteria \citep{Lueders2006,16346402}, however,
and the activity peak of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria}
occurred with a corresponding decrease in \textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose
responder relative abundance. Considering that \textit{Agromyces} and certain
\textit{Bacteroidetes} types are likely soil predators  one parsimonious
hypothesis for $^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} with a corresponding decrease in abundance of
$^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes} is that the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} fed on $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. If the
temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic
interactions, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders were consumed
by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may
be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though intra-bacteria trophic
interactions in soil C cycling are rarely considered (e.g.
\citep{Moore1988}).

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate
change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out
specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from
physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in
cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}), \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}. \textit{Spartobacteria} in
particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most
abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia} order in soil \citep{Bergmann_2011}. Our
results also suggest that members of the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil
trophic levels possibly as predators. NEEDS A FINAL SENTENCE.
