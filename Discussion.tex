\section{Discussion}

Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology
research but cultured isolates have not captured \textit{in situ} numerically
abundant genera \citep{Janssen2006}. DNA-SIP can
characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single
experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil
that incorporated $^{13}$C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and
characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling dynamics for these soluble
and polymeric C degraders. Included in $^{13}$C-xylose and
$^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs were members of cosmopolitan yet
functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as
\textit{Verrucomicrobia}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Chloroflexi}.

\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
First, labile C such as xylose was assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic
\textit{Firmicutes} spore formers. The remaining labile C and new biomass C was
assimilated in succession by slower growing \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria} phylotypes that were either
tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were predatory bacteria (e.g.
\textit{Agromyces}), and/or were specialized for consuming viral lysate. C from
polymeric substrates entered the bacterial community after 14 days. Canonical
cellulose degrading bacteria such as \textit{Cellvibrio} degraded cellulose
but uncharacterized lineages in the \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, specifically the
\textit{Spartobacteria}, were also significant contributors to cellulose
decomposition. Although the diversity of soil microbial communities is well
established (e.g. CITE Allison, Schloss), it is not clear what percentage of
that diversity works on specific C transformations. It has been proposed that
hundreds to thousands of taxa can contribute to a specific process CITE. 

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed the ecology of $^{13}$C-responsive OTUs by estimating the
\textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon labeling for each OTU.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). Ecological metrics suggest $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance than
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The higher abundance
of xylose responders may also be in part due to of their high \textit{rrn} gene
copy number resulting in inflated relative abundance per genome. 
There are only faint ecological differences within the $^{13}$C-cellulose
responsive OTUs but the combination of \textit{rrn} gene copy number, BD shift,
abundance rank and relative abundance change over time is consistent with
phylum membership (Figure~RADVIZ). $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTU \textit{rrn}
gene copy number correlated inversely with the time at which the OTU was first
found to incorporate $^{13}$C into DNA (Figure~\ref{fig:shift},
Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting that fast-growing microbes assimilated
$^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers.  

% Fakesubsubsection: Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied
Labile C responder ecological strategies were more varied than polymeric
ecological strategies perhaps because some $^{13}$C labeled microorganisms did
not primarily assimilate xylose but became labeled via predatory interactions
and/or are saprophytes. It's not clear whether the observed activity succession
from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and finally
\textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition marks a trophic
cascade or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations or
both. Notably, each temporally defined response group clustered
phylogenetically suggesting a uniform ecological strategy
(Figure~\ref{fig:trees}). It's also clear that some of the
non-\textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose responders are closely related to known
predators (\textit{Agromyces}) and many marine predatory bacteria are members
of the \textit{Bacteroidetes} (\citep{Banning2010a}). Further,
\textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously implicated as soil predatory
bacteria \citep{Lueders2006}. If the temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose
incorporation are due to trophic interactions, our results suggest that there
are many predatory soil bacteria that consume fast-growing, opportunistic,
primary labile C assimilating, gram-positive spore-formers. Hence, trophic
interactions among soil bacteria may be of importance in soil C turnover
models.

% Fakesubsubsection:How -- or if -- phylogenetic
How -- or if -- phylogenetic composition affects SOM dynamics is an open
question \citep{Schimel_2012}. It is likely that the ability to carry out soil
C transformations are redundant within and between soil microbial communities
and that in the mineral soil abiotic factors are rate limiting
\citep{Schimel_2012}. Therefore, phylogenetic composition in mineral soil
likely influences soil C fate as opposed to dynamics. We demonstrate
a phylogenetically coherent response with time to soluble C additions -- for
instance, most of the initial response to xylose can be attributed to aerobic
spore formers from few related genera. Assuming cellular resource allocation is
consistent with phylogeny, it follows then that phylogenetic composition can
significantly influence SOM fate. Polymeric C did not show the same
phylogenetic coherence as soluble C decomposition in this study. This suggests
that resource allocation among cellulose degraders would not have a single
phylogenetic signal and the fate of polymeric C would not be similarly tied to
phylogenetic composition.
% Fakesubsubsection:Environmental change has a demonstrated influence on soil
Environmental change has a demonstrated influence on soil community composition
(CITE Fierer 2007 and others). The influence of climate change on ecosystem
functions cannot be assessed until the role of diversity on ecosystem function
has been established and the impact of climate change on community composition
has been measured CITE. Our study focuses on the former. For instance, it is
not clear whether the positive relationship of diversity with functional
resiliency is due to "recruitment of a few key species from within the regional
species pool or is due to the need for a rich assortment of complementary
species" CITE. Our results suggest that few, on the order of dozens, of
specific taxa carry out specific C transformations. Further studies with
different isotopically labeled substrates and different soils will determine
how extrapolable our result is to different substrates and different soils,
respectively. 

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:SOM represents more C than the
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire soil organic matter (SOM)
influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which
microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment
microbes from uncharacterized yet ubiquitous soil lineages
participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members
of the \textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}),
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}.
\textit{Spartobacteria} in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil
microorganisms and are often the most abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia} order
in soil CITE. Our results also suggest that members of the
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} act in the cascade of
labile, soluble C through soil trophic levels possibly as predators. Both
points illustrate the complexity of soil C dynamics and fate. The largely
phylogenetically coherent ecological groups observed in this study suggest that
soil C fate is tied to phylogenetic composition.
