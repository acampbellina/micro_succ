\section{Discussion}
Discuss interpretations of plots
    -compare to literature of what we already knew about cellulose (or xylose) degradation, microbial succession, or the application of realistic C substrate additions to soil and how that gives us a more natural view of what we might expect to see in nature.  
Boast about what this technique can do/ how it's added to our field.
Discuss the short-comings


While we are currently able to resolve highly responsive OTUs which has provided greater taxonomic resolution than previous techniques (cloning, TRFLP), the next step is to find better ways to resolve taxa that are partially responsive resulting in a less dramatic effect from the microbial community than highly responsive taxa.  

PCoA demonstrates microbial succession and based on xylose and cellulose falling out separately, it indicates different microbial community members are responsible for C degradation.  Using X ordination we can tease out members that cause the greatest shift in treatment versus control.  We then generate C utilization charts to demonstration discrete OTUs in control versus treatment.  Bulk community shifts over time.
