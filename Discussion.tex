\section{Discussion} 
\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in
a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 agricultural soil
OTUs soil that incorporated $^{13}$C from xylose and/or
cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity and C-cycling
dynamics for these OTUs. We propose C added to soil microcosms took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
fast-growing \textit{Firmicutes} spore formers first
assimilated labile C followed by \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria} phylotypes. The
\textit{Bacteroidetes}, \textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria}
phylotypes may have also preyed on the rapidly responding \textit{Firmicutes}.
Bacteria incorporated C from cellulose into biomass after
14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as \textit{Cellvibrio} and
members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic
groups like \textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and
\textit{Verrucomicrobia}, specifically the \textit{Spartobacteria}, decomposed
cellulose.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed $^{13}$C-responsive OTU ecological strategy by estimating each
OTU's \textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon $^{13}$C-labeling.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance members
of the bulk community than $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The high abundance of xylose responders may also be
due in part to high \textit{rrn} gene copy number. $^{13}$C-xylose responsive
OTUs that incorporate $^{13}$C into biomass at day one had greater \textit{rrn}
gene copy number than OTUs that responded later to $^{13}$C-xylose
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting fast-growing
microbes assimilated $^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers.

% Fakesubsubsection:NRI values have been used to assess
NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering \citep{Webb2000} and have 
been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil
wet up \citep{Evans2014a,Placella2012}. To our knowledge assessing the
phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into
biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that cellulose
and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This
suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved
possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The
positive relationship with a physiological trait's phylogenetic depth and
complexity has been noted previously \citep{Martiny2013a} and the
$^{13}$C-cellulose response trait depth observed in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA
gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as that observed for glycoside
hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in cellulose degradation
\citep{Berlemont2013}. Overdispersion, as we saw for the $^{13}$C-xylose
responsive OTUs, may be indicative of an readily horizontally transferred trait
and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically. It's not clear,
though, if all $^{13}$C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of
primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it's not clear if
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single
ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups. TALK ABOUT PHLO
COHERENT TEMPORAL RESPONSE.

% Fakesubsubsection:Intuitively C cycling trait diversity is inferred
Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution
of diagnostic genes in genomes or from screen culture collections for the trait
in question CITE. For instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon
is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms participate in glucose
turnover CITE. \textit{in situ} functional guild diversity, however, can vary
significantly from diversity assessed by functionally screening isolates
and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for instance, may be less a function of
catabolic pathway distribution among genomes and more a function of lifestyle.
Soil is characterized by pulse delivery of nutrients and resources that
coincide with phenomena including seasonal change CITE, land management CITE,
and rainfall CITE. Therefore, rapid growth rates and/or the rapid resuscitation
upon wet up may control labile soil C assimilation. Growth rate and dessication
resistance are phylogenetically conserved unlike labile C degradation CITE so
labile C assimilation may be deceivingly conserved as well. DNA-SIP is useful
for establishing \textit{in situ} phylogenetic clustering and diversity of
functional guilds because DNA-SIP can incorporate life history strategies into
trait functional guild identification by targeting active microorganisms.
Snapshot estimates of community composition inform soil structure function
studies CITE Fierer but labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot
community structure but rather to community structure dynamics. Fast growing
spore formers, for example, would not need to maintain high abundance to
significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered resources. This accentuates
the usefulness of DNA-SIP for describing soil ecology as DNA-SIP assesses the
activity of microorganisms.

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil
community composition \citep{McGuire2010} which in turn influences soil
biogeochemical process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing
functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group
members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change
with community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. Aggregate
biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses such
as soil respiration involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less
influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single,
specific chemical transformation by a smaller suite of microbial participants
\citep{Schimel_1995}. Within an aggregate process such as decomposition,
subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow 
\citep{McGuire2010}. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to
be carried out by ``broad'' and ``narrow'' functional guilds, respectively
\citep{McGuire2010}. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble,
polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we
found more OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose, 63, than $^{13}$C-xylose, 49.
Also, it is possible that many $^{13}$C-xylose responders are predatory
bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Cellulose and
xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership -- of
104 $^{13}$C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose -- and
represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity
(Figure~\ref{fig:genspec}). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely
distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade cellulose,
the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not greater than
the number of cellulose decomposers.

% Fakesubsubsection:Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose
Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose responders largely clustered
near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI $>$ 0) at taxonomic levels broader
than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). Therefore
$^{13}$C-responders distribute into fewer clades than OTUs
(Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). $^{13}$C-xylose responders formed clades at
deption of X.XX sequence divergence (consenTrait) while our OTUs were
established at 0.03 sequence divergence. \textit{Active} cellulose and
xylose responder groups were ``narrow'' in that few lineages relative to total
observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose decomposition
but there is no quantitative definition of what constitutes ``narrow'' versus
``broad'' in the literature. HGT SENTENCE. TALK ABOUT TRESEDER NUMBERS?

% Fakesubsubsection:It's not clear whether the observed activity
The activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition is
a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation functional groups tuned to different
resource concentrations. \textit{Actinobacteria} (e.g. \textit{Agromyces}) and
\textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously implicated as predatory soil
bacteria \citep{Lueders2006,16346402}, however, and the activity peak of
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} occurred with
a corresponding decrease in \textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose responder
relative abundance. Considering that \textit{Agromyces} and certain
\textit{Bacteroidetes} types are likely soil predators one parsimonious
hypothesis for the $^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} with a corresponding decrease in abundance of
$^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes} is that the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} fed on $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. If the
temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic
interactions, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders were consumed
by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may
be of importance for modelling soil C turnover yet intra-bacteria trophic
interactions in soil C cycling models are rarely considered (e.g.
\citep{Moore1988}).

% Fakesubsubsection:We propose two scenarios wherein C dynamics
We propose two scenarios in the context of our results wherein C dynamics and
fate would be affected by community composition. Genomic evidence shows
cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait CITE Allison. Our
study is the first to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose
degradation \textit{in situ} via DNA-SIP and our results are consistent with
genomic evidence. Decreasing cellulose degraders would diminish cellulose
decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the
phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Ecosystem function
could be renewed by dispersed cellulose decomposers, however. For labile
C decomposition, the absence fast growing spore formers would enable other
microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid
recolonization CITE. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and
form spores. These distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct
C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may
metabolize and allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics
and fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass
C turnover by predatory bacteria that feed on fast growing, spore forming
labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal
which would allow fast growing spore formers to continuously occupy the labile
C decomposition niche even when washed out of an environment CITE. One proposed
mechanism for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in
community composition is that labile C can be used widely by microorganisms
CITE. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process rates across
different soils is that labile C degraders are easily dispersed. Notably, other
lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the
\textit{Actinobacteria} CITE Placella and many soil \textit{Actinobacteria}
form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two hypotheses are not mutually
exclusive, but our results suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to
fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal
\textit{Actinobacteria} CITE may impact labile C dynamics and fate.

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate
change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out
specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from
physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in
cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}), \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}. \textit{Spartobacteria} in
particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most
abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia} order in soil \citep{Bergmann_2011}. Labile
C in our microcosms was assimilated by fast-growing \textit{Firmicutes} spore
formers. \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria} phylotypes
previously implicated as predators by have fed on the fast growing
\textit{Firmicutes}. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan
\textit{Spartobacteria} may degrade cellulose on a global scale, tropic
interactions within bacteria are important for modeling soil C cycling, and 
functional guild diversity may be constrained by ecological strategies which
can be more phylogenetically conserved than catabolic pathways.
