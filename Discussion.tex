\section{Discussion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil 
Pure culture based studies have historically driven soil microbial ecology
research but culturing has not captured \textit{in situ} numerically abundant
soil genera \citep{Janssen2006}. DNA-SIP can characterize functional roles for
thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We
identified 104 OTUs in an agricultural soil that incorporated $^{13}$C from
xylose and/or cellulose into biomass and characterized substrate specificity
and C-cycling dynamics for these OTUs. $^{13}$C-xylose and $^{13}$C-cellulose
responsive OTUs included members of cosmopolitan yet functionally
uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups such as \textit{Verrucomicrobia},
\textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Chloroflexi}.

\subsection{Microbial response to isotopic labels}
% Fakesubsubsection: We propose that microbial decomposition
We propose that C added to soil microcosms in this experiment took the
following path through the microbial food web (Figure~\ref{fig:foodweb}):
Labile C such as xylose was first assimilated by fast-growing opportunistic
\textit{Firmicutes} aerobic spore formers. The remaining labile C biomass
C from growing \textit{Firmicutes} was assimilated in succession by 
\textit{Bacteroidetes}, \textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria}
phylotypes that were tuned to lower C substrate concentrations, were
predatory bacteria (e.g. \textit{Agromyces}), and/or were specialized for
consuming viral lysate. C from polymeric substrates was decomposed by bacteria
after 14 days. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria such as
\textit{Cellvibrio} degraded cellulose but uncharacterized lineages in the
\textit{Chloroflexi}, \textit{Planctomycetes} and \textit{Verrucomicrobia},
specifically the \textit{Spartobacteria}, were also significant contributors to
cellulose decomposition.

\subsection{Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the
decomposition of organic matter}
% Fakesubsubsection:We assessed the ecology of
We assessed the ecology of $^{13}$C-responsive OTUs by estimating each OTU's
the \textit{rrn} gene copy number and the BD shift upon $^{13}$C-labeling.
\textit{rrn} gene copy number correlates positively with growth rate
\citep{11125085} and BD shift is indicative of substrate specificity (see
results). Ecological metrics predict $^{13}$C-cellulose responsive OTUs grow
slower (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}), have greater substrate
specificity (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}), and are generally lower abundance members
of the bulk community than $^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). The higher abundance of xylose responders may also be
in part due to higher \textit{rrn} gene copy number. $^{13}$C-xylose responsive
OTUs that responded beginning at day 3 had greater \textit{rrn} gene copy
number than OTUs that responded to $^{13}$C-xylose later
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}) suggesting fast-growing
microbes assimilated $^{13}$C from xylose before slow growers.

% Fakesubsubsection:NRI values have been used to assess
NRI values are useful metrics for assessing phylogenetic clustering
\citep{Webb2000} and have recently been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs
categorized by response to wet up \citep{Evans2014a,Placella2012}. To our
knowledge assessing the phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate
heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We
found that cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed,
respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is
phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose
degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship with a physiological
trait's phylogenetic depth and complexity has been noted previously
\citep{Martiny2013a} and the $^{13}$C-cellulose response trait depth observed
in this study (X.XX 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence) is on the same order as
that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes in
cellulose degradation \citep{Berlemont2013}. Overdispersion, as we saw for the
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a trait that can be
transferred between species via horizontal gene transfer and/or a trait that is
broadly distributed phylogenetically. It's not clear, though, if all
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose
assimilation (see below), and therefore it's not clear if $^{13}$C-xylose
responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful
group or multiple ecological groups. TALK ABOUT PHLO COHERENT TEMPORAL
RESPONSE.

\subsection{Implications for soil C cycling models}
% Fakesubsubsection:Land management, climate, pollution and
Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can all influence soil
community composition \citep{McGuire2010} which in turn can influence soil
biogeochemical process rates (e.g. \citep{Berlemont2014a}). Assessing
functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group
members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates can change
with community composition \citep{Schimel_1995,McGuire2010}. 
Biogeochemical processes that are the aggregate of many subprocesses such as
soil respiration involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less
influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single,
specific chemical transformation and a smaller suite of microbial participants
\citep{Schimel_1995}. Within an aggregate process such as decomposition,
subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow processes
\citep{McGuire2010}. Labile and recalcitrant C decomposition are considered to
be carried out by ``broad'' and ``narrow'' functional guilds, respectively
\citep{McGuire2010}. However, the diversity of active labile C and insoluble,
polymeric C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we
found more OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose, 63, than $^{13}$C-xylose, 49.
Also, it is possible that many $^{13}$C-xylose responders are predatory
bacteria as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). The cellulose
and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership and
represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity
(Figure~\ref{fig:genspec}); of 104 $^{13}$C-responders only 8 responded to both
cellulose and xylose. Interestingly, while xylose use is undoubtedly more
widely distributed among global microorganisms than the ability to degrade
cellulose, the number of active xylose utilizers in our microcosms was not
greater than the number of cellulose decomposers.

% Fakesubsubsection:Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose
Both $^{13}$C-cellulose and $^{13}$C-xylose responders were largely clustered
near the tips of the phylogenetic tree (NTI $>$ 0) at taxonomic levels broader
than the OTUs established in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). Therefore
$^{13}$C-responders can be distributed into even fewer clades than number of
OTUs (Figure~\ref{fig:tiledtree}). The consenTRAIT estimate for the breadth of
the xylose use trait is X.XX, for instance, while our OTUs were established at
0.03 sequence identity divergence. \textit{Active} cellulose and xylose
responder groups were ``narrow'' in that few lineages relative to total
observed lineages were active participants in cellulose or xylose
decomposition but there is not working quantitative definition of what
constitutes ``narrow'' versus ``broad'' in the literature. HGT SENTENCE.

% Fakesubsubsection:It's not clear whether the observed activity
The activity succession from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
finally \textit{Actinobacteria} in response to $^{13}$C-xylose addition is
a trophic cascade and/or the manifestation of the activity of functional
groups tuned to different resource concentrations. \textit{Actinobacteria}
(e.g. \textit{Agromyces}) and \textit{Bacteroidetes} have been previously
implicated as predatory soil bacteria \citep{Lueders2006,16346402}, however,
and the activity peak of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Actinobacteria}
occurred with a corresponding decrease in \textit{Firmicutes} $^{13}$C-xylose
responder relative abundance. Considering that \textit{Agromyces} and certain
\textit{Bacteroidetes} types are likely soil predators  one parsimonious
hypothesis for $^{13}$C-labelling of \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} with a corresponding decrease in abundance of
$^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes} is that the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} fed on $^{13}$C-labeled \textit{Firmicutes}. If the
temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic
interactions, many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders were consumed
by predatory bacteria. Hence, predatory interactions between soil bacteria may
be of importance for modelling soil C turnover though intra-bacteria trophic
interactions in soil C cycling are rarely considered (e.g.
\citep{Moore1988}).

% Fakesubsubsection:We propose two scenarios wherein C dynamics
We propose two scenarios wherein C dynamics and fate would be affected
by community composition in the context of our results. Genomic evidence shows
cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait CITE Allison. This
study is the first to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose
degradation \textit{in situ} via DNA-SIP and our results are consistent with
genomic evidence. Decreasing cellulose degraders would diminish cellulose
decomposition process rates. Few soil microorganisms can fill the
phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Ecosystem function
could be renewed by dispersed cellulose decomposers, however. For labile
C decomposition, the absence fast growing spore formers would enable other
microbes to assimilate labile C when dispersal does not enable rapid
recolonization CITE. The primary labile C degraders in this study were fast
growers, and had a distinct lifestyle (spore formation) which might indicate
distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may
metabolize and allocate labile C differently changing labile C dynamics and
fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover
by predatory bacteria that feed on fast growing, spore forming labile
C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal CITE. One
proposed mechanism for similar labile C decomposition rates across soils that
vary in community composition is that labile materials can be used widely by
microorganisms CITE. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process
rates across soils is that labile C degraders are easily dispersed. Notably,
other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the
\textit{Actinobacteria} CITE Placella and many soil \textit{Actinobacteria}
form hyphae that facilitate dispersal CITE. The two hypotheses are not mutually
exclusive, however, but our results suggest that environmental conditions
unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal
\textit{Actinobacteria} CITE may impact labile C dynamics and fate.

% Fakesubsubsection:Intuitively C cycling trait diversity is inferred
Intuitively C cycling functional guild diversity is inferred from the
distribution of diagnostic genes CITE. For instance, the wide distribution of
the glycolysis operon is interpreted as evidence many soil microorganisms
participate in glucose turnover CITE. We suggest that \textit{in situ}
functional guild diversity can vary significantly from guild diversity assessed
by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for
instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution among
genomes and more a function of microorganism lifestyle. Soil is characterized
by pulse delivery of nutrients that coincide with phenomena including seasonal
change, land management, and rainfall CITE. Therefore, rapid growth rates
and/or the rapid resuscitation upon wet up may control labile soil
C assimilation. Growth rate and dessication resistance are phylogenetically
conserved unlike labile C degradation so labile C assimilation may be
deceivingly conserved as well. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing \textit{in
situ} phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because
DNA-SIP can incorporate life history strategies into trait functional guild
identification.

\subsection{Conclusion} 
% Fakesubsubsection:Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire
Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate
change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out
specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from
physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in
cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (\textit{Spartobacteria}), \textit{Chloroflexi},
\textit{Bacteroidetes} and \textit{Planctomycetes}. \textit{Spartobacteria} in
particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most
abundant \textit{Verrucomicrobia} order in soil \citep{Bergmann_2011}. Our
results also suggest that members of the \textit{Bacteroidetes} and
\textit{Actinobacteria} act in the cascade of labile, soluble C through soil
trophic levels possibly as predators. NEEDS A FINAL SENTENCE.
