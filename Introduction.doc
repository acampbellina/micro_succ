<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) stored in soils worldwide which accounts for <span class="math"> ∼ </span>80% of the global terrestrial C pool <span class="citation">(1, 2)</span>. When organic C from plants reaches soil it is degraded by fungi, archaea, and bacteria. The majority of plant biomass C in soil is respired and produces 10 times more CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> annually than anthropogenic emissions <span class="citation">(3)</span>. Global changes in atmospheric CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, temperature, and ecosystem nitrogen inputs are expected to impact soil C input <span class="citation">(4)</span>. Current climate change models concur on atmospheric and oceanic but not terrestrial C predictions <span class="citation">(5)</span>. Contrasting terrestrial C model predictions reflect how little is known about soil C cycling. Inconsistencies in terrestial modeling could be improved by elucidating the relationship between dissolved organic C and soil microbial community composition <span class="citation">(6)</span>.</p>
<p>An important step in understanding soil C cycling dynamics is identifying the <em>in situ</em> activity of specific microbial lineages to establish relationship between community structure and function <span class="citation">(7)</span>. An estimated 80-90% of soil C cycling is mediated by microorganisms <span class="citation">(8, 9)</span> but understanding microbial processing of soil nutrients is challenging due to soil’s hetergeneous nature and methods limitations. The vast majority of microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory. Stable-isotope probing (SIP) links microbial identity and activity without cultivation and has expanded our knowledge of microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes <span class="citation">(10)</span>. The most successful applications of SIP have identified organisms which mediate processes performed by a narrow set of functional guilds such as methanogens <span class="citation">(11)</span>. SIP has been less applicable to the study of soil C cycling because of limitations in resolving power as a result of simultaneous labeling of many different organisms in the community. Additionally, molecular applications such as tRFLP, DGGE and cloning that are frequently used in conjunction with SIP provide insufficient resolution of taxon identity and/or depth of coverage. We developed an approach called <strong>H</strong>igh <strong>R</strong>esolution-SIP (HR-SIP) that employs a complex mixture of substrates added to soil at a low concentration relative to soil organic matter pools along with high throughput DNA sequencing. This greatly expands the ability of nucleic acid SIP to explore complex patterns of C-cycling in microbial communities with increased resolution.</p>
<p>A temporal activity cascade occurs in natural microbial communities during plant biomass degradation in which labile C is degraded before polymeric C <span class="citation">(12, 13)</span>. The aim of this study was to observe temporal dynamics of C assimilation through discrete soil community members. Our experimental approach included the addition of a soil organic matter (SOM) simulant (a complex mixture of model carbon sources and inorganic nutrients common to plant biomass) so soil microcosms where a single C component is substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled equivalent. Parallel incubations of soils amended with this complex C mixture allows us to observer how different C substrates move through the soil microbial community. In this study we used <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose as a proxy for labile and polymeric C, respectively, and coupled nucleic acid stable isotope probing with high throughput DNA sequencing. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments from many gradient fractions and multiple gradients make it possible to track C associated activities for hundreds of soil taxa.</p>
