<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) in soils worldwide which accounts for <span class="math"> ∼ </span>80% of the global terrestrial C pool <span class="citation">(1, 2)</span>. Fungi, archaea, and bacteria degrade plant biomass that reaches soil. Microorganisms respire the majority of plant biomass producing 10 times more CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> annually than anthropogenic emissions <span class="citation">(3)</span>. Rising atmospheric CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> may stimulate plant growth and in turn increase plant biomass C input to soil <span class="citation">(4)</span>. Current climate change models concur on atmospheric and oceanic, but not terrestrial, C predictions <span class="citation">(5)</span>. Contrasting terrestrial C model predictions reflect how little is known about soil C cycling. We must establish the roles and diversity of soil microbial community members in soil C cycling to reconcile inconsistencies in terrestial C models <span class="citation">(<strong>???</strong>, 6)</span>.</p>
<p>we must identify the <em>in situ</em> activity of soil microbes to establish soil structure function relationships <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Microorganisms mediate an estimated 80-90% of soil C cycling <span class="citation">(8, 9)</span>. The complexity of soil obfuscates microbial contributions to soil C cycling and the majority of microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory. Stable-isotope probing (SIP) links genetic identity and activity without cultivation and has expands our knowledge of microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes <span class="citation">(10)</span>. Successful applications of SIP have identified organisms which mediate processes performed by functionally specialized microorganisms of limited diversity such as methanogens <span class="citation">(11)</span> but SIP has been less applicable in soil C cycling studies because simultaneous labeling of many different organisms required inhibitory resolving power. High throughput DNA sequencing technology, however, improves the resolving power of SIP enabling exploration of complex soil C-cycling patterns.</p>
<p>This study aimed to observe labile C versus polymeric C assimilation dynamics in the soil microbial community. We added a mixture of nutrients and C substrates to soil microcosms that simulated the composition of plant biomass. We set up three microcosm series: in one series xylose was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-equivalent, in another cellulose was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-equivalent, and in the third series all substrates in the mixture were unlabeled. We used labeled xylose and cellulose to contrast labile C and polymeric C decomposition, respectively and we sequenced 16S rRNA genes from SIP density fractions with high throughput DNA sequencing technology. Our experimental design allowed us to observe the soil microbial community members that assimilated xylose-C and cellulose-C over time.</p>
