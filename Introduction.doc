<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) stored in soils worldwide which accounts for <span class="math"> ∼ </span>80% of the global terrestrial C pool <span class="citation">(1, 2)</span>. When organic C from plants reaches soil it is degraded by fungi, archaea, and bacteria. This C is returned to the atmosphere as CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> or remains in the soil as humic substances that can persist up to 2000 years <span class="citation">(3)</span>. The majority of plant biomass C in soil is respired and produces 10 times more CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> than anthropogenic emissions on an annual basis <span class="citation">(4)</span>. Global changes in atmospheric CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, temperature, and ecosystem nitrogen inputs are expected to impact primary production and C inputs to soils <span class="citation">(5)</span> but it remains difficult to predict the response of soil processes to anthropogenic change <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Current climate change models concur on atmospheric and oceanic but not terrestrial C predictions <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Contrasting terrestrial C model predictions reflect how little is known about soil C cycling. Inconsistencies in terrestial modeling could be improved by elucidating the relationship between dissolved organic carbon and microbial communities in soils <span class="citation">(8)</span>.</p>
<p>An estimated 80-90% of C cycling in soil is mediated by microorganisms <span class="citation">(9, 10)</span>. Understanding microbial processing of nutrients in soils presents a special challenge due to the hetergeneous nature of soil ecosystems and methods limitations. Soils are biologically, chemically, and physically complex which affects microbial community composition, diversity, and structure <span class="citation">(10)</span>. Confounding factors such as physical protection/aggregation, moisture content, pH, temperature, frequency and type of land disturbance, soil history, mineralogy, N quality and availability, and litter quality all affect the ability of the soil microbial community to access and metabolize C substrates <span class="citation">(11, 12)</span>. Further, rates of metabolism are often measured without knowing the identity of the microbial species involved <span class="citation">(13)</span> leaving the importance of community membership towards maintaining ecosystem functions unknown <span class="citation">(13–15)</span>. Litter bag experiments have shown that the community composition of soils can have quantitative and qualitative impacts on the breakdown of plant materials <span class="citation">(16)</span>. Reciprocal exchange of litter type and microbial inocula under controlled environmental conditions reveals that differences in community composition can account for 85% of the variation in litter carbon mineralization <span class="citation">(17)</span>. In addition, assembled communities of cellulose degraders reveal that the composition of the community has significant impacts on the rate of cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(18)</span>.</p>
<p>An important step in understanding soil C cycling dynamics is identifying contributions from specific microbial lineages and investigating the relationship between genetic diversity and community structure with function <span class="citation">(19)</span>. The vast majority of microorganisms continue to resist cultivation in the laboratory, and even when cultivation is achieved, the traits expressed by a microorganism in culture may not be representative of those expressed when in its natural habitat. Stable-isotope probing (SIP) provides a unique opportunity to link microbial identity to activity and has been utilized to expand our knowledge of biogeochemical processes <span class="citation">(20)</span>. The most successful applications of this technique have identified organisms which mediate processes performed by a narrow set of functional guilds such as methanogens <span class="citation">(21)</span>. The technique has been less applicable to the study of soil C cycling because of limitations in resolving power as a result of simultaneous labeling of many different organisms in the community. Additionally, molecular applications such as tRFLP, DGGE and cloning that are frequently used in conjunction with SIP provide insufficient resolution of taxon identity and depth of coverage. We have developed an approach called <strong>H</strong>igh <strong>R</strong>esolution-SIP (HR-SIP) that employs a complex mixture of substrates added to soil at a low concentration relative to soil organic matter pools along with high throughput DNA sequencing. This greatly expands the ability of nucleic acid SIP to explore complex patterns of C-cycling in microbial communities with increased resolution.</p>
<p>A temporal cascade occurs in natural microbial communities during the plant biomass degradation in which labile C degradation precedes polymeric C degradation <span class="citation">(22, 23)</span>. The aim of this study is to track the temporal dynamics of C assimilation through discrete individuals of the soil microbial community to provide greater insight into soil C-cycling. Our experimental approach includes the addition of a soil organic matter (SOM) simulant (a complex mixture of model carbon sources and inorganic nutrients common to plant biomass), where a single C constituent is substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled equivalent, to soil. Parallel incubations of soils amended with this complex C mixture allows us to test how different C substrates cascade through discrete taxa within the soil microbial community. In this study we use <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose as a proxy for labile and polymeric C, respectively. We couple nucleic acid stable isotope probing with high throughput DNA sequencing to identify soil microbial community members responsible for specific C transformations. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments from many gradient fractions and multiple gradients make it possible to track C assimilation by hundreds of taxa.</p>
