Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) in soils
worldwide which accounts for $\sim$80\% of the global terrestrial C pool
\citep{Amundson_2001,BATJES_1996}. Fungi, archaea, and bacteria degrade plant
biomass that reaches soil. Microorganisms respire the majority of plant biomass
producing 10 times more CO$_{2}$ annually than anthropogenic emissions
\citep{chapin2002principles}. Rising atmospheric CO$_{2}$ may stimulate
plant growth and in turn increase plant biomass C input to soil
\citep{Groenigen_2006} and current climate change models concur on atmospheric
and oceanic, but not terrestrial, C flux predictions
\citep{Friedlingstein_2006}. Contrasting terrestrial C model predictions
reflect how little is known about soil C cycling. We need to establish the
roles and diversity of soil microbial community members involved with soil
C cycling to reconcile inconsistencies in terrestial C models
\citep{Neff_2001,McGuire2010a}.

% Fakesubsubsection:An important step in understanding soil C cycling
Functional guild membership and diversity establishes the connections between
soil functions and community structure \citep{O_Donnell_2002}. Microorganisms
mediate an estimated 80-90\% of soil C cycling
\citep{ColemanCrossley_1996,Nannipieri_2003}. The complexity of soil obfuscates
microbial contributions to soil C cycling and the majority of microorganisms
resist cultivation in the laboratory. Stable-isotope probing (SIP) links
genetic identity and activity without cultivation and has expands our knowledge
of microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes
\citep{Chen_Murrell_2010}. Successful applications of SIP have identified
organisms which mediate processes performed by functionally specialized
microorganisms of limited diversity such as methanogens \citep{Lu_2005} but SIP
has been less applicable in soil C cycling studies because simultaneous
labeling of many different organisms required inhibitory resolving power. High
throughput DNA sequencing technology, however, improves the resolving power of
SIP enabling exploration of complex soil C-cycling patterns.

% Fakesubsubsection:A temporal cascade occurs in natural microbial
This study aimed to observe labile C versus polymeric C assimilation dynamics
in the soil microbial community. We added mixture of nutrients and
C substrates to soil microcosms that simulated the composition of plant
biomass. All microcosms received the same C substrate mixture where the only
difference between treatments was the identity of the isotopically
labeled substrate. Specifically, we set up a series of microcosms with three
treatments: in one treatment xylose was substituted for its
$^{13}$C-equivalent, in another cellulose was substituted for its
$^{13}$C-equivalent, and in the third treatment all substrates in the mixture
were unlabeled. We harvested microcosms at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 except day
1 where only $^{13}$C-xylose treated microcosms were harvested. We used labeled
xylose and cellulose to contrast labile C and polymeric C decomposition,
respectively and we sequenced 16S rRNA genes from SIP density fractions with
high throughput DNA sequencing technology. Our experimental design allowed us
to observe the soil microbial community members that assimilated xylose-C and
cellulose-C over time.
