\section{Introduction}
% Fakesubsubsection:Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of
Soils worldwide contain 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) which accounts for nearlyâ€„80\%
of the C present in the terrestrial biosphere
\citep{Amundson_2001,BATJES_1996}. Microbial soil C respiration produces
annually tenfold more CO$_{2}$ than fossil fuel emissions
\citep{chapin2002principles} yet many global C biogeochemical flux models
ignore microbial physiological diversity and its impacts on microbial activity
in soils despite the significant contribution of microbial activity to global
soil C flux. \citep{Allison2010,Six2006,Treseder2011}. It remains difficult to
predict the response of soil C to changes in climate
\citep{Nett_2001,Davidson2006a,Todd-Brown2013} but predictions of climate
change feedbacks on soil C flux improve when biogeochemical models explicitly
represent microbial physiology \citep{Wieder2013}. However, we still know
little of the ecophysiology of soil microorganisms. Efforts that describe soil
microorganism ecophysiology relevant to soil C biogeochemical fluxes should
assist the development and refinement of terrestrial C biogeochemical models
\citep{Bradford2008,Neff_2001,McGuire2010}.

%Fakesubsubsection:The decomposition
Cellulose comprises most plant C (30-50\%) followed by hemicellulose (20-40\%),
and lignin (15-25\%) \citep{Lynd2002}. Hemicellulose, being the most soluble,
degrades most easily as compared to cellulose and lignin, and is targeted in
the early stages of decomposition. Hemicellulose composition varies
considerably with xylans being the most abundant constituent, themselves
composed of differing amounts of xylose, glucose, arabinose, galactose,
mannose, and rhamnose \citep{Saha2003}. Xylose is often the most abundant sugar
in hemicellulose, comprising as much as 60-90\% of xylan in some plants (e.g
hardwoods) \citep{Spiridon2008}, wheat \citep{Sun2005}, and switchgrass
\citep{Bunnell2013}. Microbes that respire sugars proliferate during the
initial stages of decomposition \citep{Garrett1951,Alexander1964}, and
metabolize as much as 75\% of sugar C during the first 5 days of decomposition
\citep{Engelking2007}. In contrast, cellulose degradation rates increase slowly
for approximately 15 days and cellulose degradation continues for 30-90 days
\citep{Hu1997,Engelking2007}. It is hypothesized that microbes specialize in
the decomposition of specific compounds in fresh, plant-derived organic matter
and that these functionally specific guilds of microorganisms proliferate in
succession as plant C of decreasing lability is decomposed over time
\citep{Hu1997,Rui2009,AnneliseHKjoller2002,Bastian2009}. For instance, this
degradative succession hypothesis posits that rapidly growing plant sugar
decomposers respond quickly \citep{Garrett1963,Bremer1994} and are followed by
slow growing degraders of plant polymers \citep{Garrett1963}. Evidence to
support the degradative succession hypothesis comes from observing soil
respiration dynamics and characterizing microbes cultivated at different stages
of decomposition. The degree to which the succession hypothesis presents an
accurate model of litter decomposition has been called into question
\citep{AnneliseHKjoller2002,Frankland1998,osono2005} and it's clear that new
approaches are needed to dissect microbial contributions to C transformations
in soils.

% Fakesubsubsection:An important step in understanding soil C cycling
Functional guild membership and diversity establish the connections between
soil functions and community structure \citep{O_Donnell_2002}. Microorganisms
mediate an estimated 80-90\% of soil C cycling
\citep{ColemanCrossley_1996,Nannipieri_2003} but the complexity of soil
obfuscates microbial contributions to soil C cycling and the majority of
microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory. Stable-isotope probing
(SIP), however, links genetic identity and activity without cultivation and has
expanded our knowledge of microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes
\citep{Chen_Murrell_2010}. Successful applications of SIP have identified
organisms which mediate processes performed by functionally specialized
microorganisms of limited diversity such as methanogens \citep{Lu_2005} but SIP
has been less applicable in soil C cycling studies because simultaneous
labeling of many different organisms requires prohibitive resolving power to
successfully employ SIP. High throughput DNA sequencing technology, however,
improves the resolving power of SIP enabling exploration of complex soil
C-cycling processes.

%Fakesubsubsection:Though microorganisms mediate
Though microorganisms mediate 80-90\% of the soil C-cycle (9, 10), and the
physiological ecology of microorganisms can influence the dynamics of
C transformations, terrestrial C-cycle models rarely consider the
community composition of soils \citep{Zak2006,Reed2007}. Metabolic rates
of soil C transformations are measured without knowledge of the organisms that
mediate these reactions \citep{Nannipieri_2003}, leaving undefined the
importance of community membership towards maintaining ecosystem function
\citep{Nannipieri_2003,Schimel_2012,Allison_2008}. However, microbial community
composition can account for significant variation in litter
C mineralization \citep{Strickland_2009}. Variation in microbial community
composition can be linked most directly to rates of soil processes when
discrete functional genes are available to represent those processes (e.g.
denitrification \citep{Cavigelli2000}, nitrification 

(Carney et al. 2004, Hawkes et al. 2005, Webster et al. 2005), methanotrophy

(Gulledge et al. 1997) 

, and nitrogen fixation 

(Hsu and Buckley 2009)

). However, the complexity of soil C transformations and the lack of convenient
functional genes for describing these transformations has limited progress in
characterizing the contributions of individual microbes to the soil C-cycle.
Remarkably, we still lack information on the physiology and ecology of the
majority of organisms that live in soils. For example, the bacterial phyla
Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia are nearly
ubiquitous in soils, they comprise collectively up to 32% of the SSU rRNA genes
in soil 

(Buckley 2002 in Biodiversity of Microbial Life; Janssen 2006 AEM
72:1719-1728), 

but their contributions to soil processes remain almost completely
uncharacterized. 

% Fakesubsubsection:A temporal cascade occurs in natural microbial
This study aimed to compare labile versus polymeric C assimilation dynamics and
participants in the soil microbial community. We added a mixture of nutrients
and C substrates to soil microcosms that simulated the composition of plant
biomass. All microcosms received the same C substrate mixture where the only
difference between treatments was the identity of the isotopically labeled
substrate. We added the C substrate mixture to three series of
microcosms: in one series xylose was substituted for its $^{13}$C-equivalent,
in another cellulose was substituted for its $^{13}$C-equivalent, and in the
third treatment all substrates in the mixture were unlabeled. We harvested
microcosms from each treatment at days 3, 7, 14, and 30 and additionally
harvested microcosms receiving $^{13}$C-xylose and unlabeled substrates on day
1. We chose to label xylose and cellulose to contrast labile C and polymeric
C decomposition, respectively. Post incubation, we sequenced 16S rRNA genes
from SIP density gradient fractions. Our experimental design allowed us to
identify which soil microbial community members assimilated xylose-C
and cellulose-C over time.
