<p>Twelve soil cores (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) were collected from six random sampling locations within an organically managed agricultural field in Penn Yan, New York. Soils were pretreated by sieving (2 mm), homogenizing sieved soil, and pre-incubating 10 g of dry soil weight in flasks for 2 weeks. Soils were amended with a 5.3 mg g soil<sup>-1</sup> carbon mixture; representative of natural concentrations <span class="citation">Reference 1</span>. Mixture contained 38% cellulose, 23% lignin, 20% xylose, 3% arabinose, 1% galactose, 1% glucose, and 0.5% mannose by mass, with the remaining 13.5% mass composed of an amino acid (in-house made replica of Teknova C0705) and basal salt mixture (Murashige and Skoog, Sigma Aldrich M5524). Three parallel treatments were performed; (1) unlabeled control,(2)<sup>13</sup>C-cellulose, (3)<sup>13</sup>C-xylose (98 atom% <sup>13</sup>C, Sigma Aldrich). Each treatment had 2 replicates per time point (n = 4) except day 30 which had 4 replicates; total microcosms per treatment n = 12, except <sup>13</sup>C-cellulose which was not sampled at day 1, n = 10. Other details relating to substrate addition can be found in SI. Microcosms were sampled destructively (stored at -80<span class="math"><em></em><sup> ∘ </sup></span>C until nucleic acid processing) at days 1 (control and xylose only), 3, 7, 14, and 30.</p>
<p>Nucleic acids were extracted using a modified Griffiths procotol <span class="citation">Reference 2</span>. To prepare nucleic acid extracts for isopycnic centrifugation as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 3</span>, DNA was size selected (&gt;4kb) using 1% low melt agarose gel and <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>-agarase I enzyme extraction per manufacturers protocol (New England Biolab, M0392S). For each time point in the series isopycnic gradients were setup using a modified protocol <span class="citation">Reference 4</span> for a total of five <sup>12</sup>C-control, five <sup>13</sup>C-xylose, and four <sup>13</sup>C-cellulose microcosms. A density gradient (average density 1.69 g mL<sup>-1</sup>) solution of 1.762 g cesium chloride (CsCl) ml<sup>-1</sup> in gradient buffer solution (pH 8.0 15 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM EDTA, 15 mM KCl) was used to separate <sup>13</sup>C-enriched and <sup>12</sup>C-nonenriched DNA. Each gradient was loaded with approximately 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>g of DNA and ultracentrifuged for 66 h at 55,000 rpm and room temperature (RT). Fractions of <span class="math"> ∼ </span>100 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L were collected from below by displacing the DNA-CsCl-gradient buffer solution in the centrifugation tube with water using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3.3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L s<sup>-1</sup> <span class="citation">Reference 5</span> into Acroprep<sup>TM</sup> 96 filter plate (Pall Life Sciences 5035). The refractive index of each fraction was measured using a Reichart AR200 digital refractometer modified as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 3</span> to measure a volume of 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L. Then buoyant density was calculated from the refractive index as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 3</span> (see also SI). The collected DNA fractions were purified by repetitive washing of Acroprep filter wells with TE. Finally, 50 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L TE was added to each fraction then resuspended DNA was pipetted off the filter into a new microfuge tube.</p>
<p>For every gradient, 20 fractions were chosen for sequencing between the density range 1.67-1.75 g mL<sup>-1</sup>. Barcoded 454 primers were designed using 454-specific adapter B, 10 bp barcodes <span class="citation">Reference 6</span>, a 2 bp linker (5’-CA-3’), and 806R primer for reverse primer (BA806R); and 454-specific adapter A, a 2 bp linker (5’-TC-3’), and 515F primer for forward primer (BA515F). Each fraction was PCR amplified using 0.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 U <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>l<sup>-1</sup> AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; N8080243), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10X Buffer II (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 25 mM MgCl<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, 4 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 mM dNTP, 1.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> BSA, 0.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA515F, 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA806R, 3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L H<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>O, 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 1:30 DNA template) in triplicate. Samples were normalized either using Pico green quantification and manual calculation or by SequalPrep<sup>TM</sup> normalization plates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; A10510), then pooled in equimolar concentrations. Pooled DNA was gel extracted from a 1% agarose gel using Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI; A9281) per manufacturer’s protocol. Amplicons were sequenced on Roche 454 FLX system using titanium chemistry at Selah Genomics (formerly EnGenCore, Columbia, SC)</p>
