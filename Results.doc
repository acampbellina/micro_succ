<p>Our experimental design allowed us to track the flow of xylose and cellulose C through the soil microbial community (Figure [fig:setup]). 5.3 mg C substrate mixture per gram of soil was added to each microcosm representing 18% of the soil C. The mixture included 0.42 mg xylose-C and 0.88 mg cellulose-C per gram soil. Microcosms were harvested at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 during a 30 day incubation. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilation peaked immediately and tapered over the 30 day incubation whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose assimilation peaked two weeks after amendment additions (Figure [fig:ord], Figure [fig:rspndr<sub>c</sub>ount]). See Supplemental Note XX for sequencing and density fractionation statistics. Microcosm treatments (see Methods) are identified in figures by the following code: “13CXPS” refers to the amendment with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (<span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span><strong>C</strong> <strong>X</strong>ylose <strong>P</strong>lant <strong>S</strong>imulant), “13CCPS” refers to the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose amendment and “12CCPS” refers to the amendment that only contained <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C (i.e. control).</p>
<h2 id="soil-microcosm-microbial-community-changes-with-time">Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time</h2>
<p>Changes in the bulk soil microcosm microbial community structure and membership correlated significantly with time (Figure [fig:bulk<sub>o</sub>rd], P-value 0.23, R<span class="math"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span> 0.63, Adonis test <span class="citation">(1)</span>). The identity of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled substrate added to the microcosms did not significantly correlate with bulk soil community structure and membership (P-value 0.35). Additionally, microcosm beta diversity was significantly less than gradient fraction beta diversity (Figure [fig:bulk<sub>o</sub>rd], P-value 0.003, “betadisper” function R Vegan package <span class="citation">(2, 3)</span>). Twenty-nine OTUs significantly changed in relative abundance with time (“BH” adjusted P-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span> 0.10, <span class="citation">(4)</span>) and of these 29 OTUs, 14 were found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from labeled substrates into biomass (Figure [fig:time]). Four taxonomic classes significantly (adjusted P-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span> 0.10) changed in abundance: <em>Bacilli</em> (decreased), <em>Flavobacteria</em> (decreased), <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> (decreased) and <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> (increased) (Figure [fig:time<sub>c</sub>lass]). Abundances grouped by phylum for OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose increased with time whereas abundances grouped by phylum of OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose decreased over time although <em>Proteobacteria</em> abundance spiked at day 14 (Figure [fig:babund]).</p>
<h2 id="responders">OTUs that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA</h2>
<p>Within the first 7 days of incubation 63% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose was respired and only 6% more was respired from day 7 to 30. At day 30, 30% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose remained in the soil. An average 16% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose added was respired within the first 7 days, 38% by day 14, and 60% by day 30.</p>
<p>We refer to OTUs that putatively incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA originally from an isotopically labeled substrate as substrate “responders” (see Supplemental Note XX for operational “response” criteria). There were 19, 19, 15, 6, and 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, respectively (Figure [fig:rspndr<sub>c</sub>ount]). The numerically dominant <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder phylum shifted from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and then to <em>Actinobacteria</em> across days 1, 3 and 7 (Figure [fig:l2fc], Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]). <em>Proteobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were found at days 1, 3, 7 but peaked at day 7 (Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]).</p>
<p>Only 2 and 5 OTUs responded <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30, 42 and 39 OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose. (Figure [fig:rspndr<sub>c</sub>ount]). <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, and <em>Chloroflexi</em> had relatively high numbers of responders with strong response across multiple time points (Figure [fig:l2fc]). <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were 70% <em>Spartobacteria</em>. <em>Chloroflexi</em> responders were annotated as members of the <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> and <em>Anaerolineae</em> (Figure [fig:tiledtrees]). <em>Cellvibrio</em>, a canonical soil cellulose degrader, was found to respond strongly to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose in the microcosms. See Supplemental Note XX for further counts of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs at greater taxonomic resolution.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-13c-responders">Ecological strategies of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C responders</h2>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based on relative abundance in bulk DNA SSU rRNA gene content than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders (Figure [fig:shift], P-value 0.00028, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). However, both abundant and rare OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:shift]). Two <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were not found in any bulk samples (“OTU.862” and “OTU.1312”, Table [tab:cell]). Of the 10 most abundant responders, 8 are <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders and 6 of these 8 are consistently among the 10 most abundant OTUs in bulk samples.</p>
<p>Cellulose responder buoyant density (BD) shifted further along the density gradient than xylose responder BD in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation (Figure [fig:c1], Figure [fig:shift], P-value 1.8610x<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 06</sup></span>, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responder BD shifted on average 0.0163 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094) whereas xylose responder BD shifted on average 0.0097 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094). For reference, 100% <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C DNA BD is 0.04 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> greater than the BD of its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C counterpart. DNA BD increases as its ratio of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C increases. An organism that only assimilates C into DNA from a <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C isotopically labeled source, will have a greater <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C ratio in its DNA than an organism utilizing a mixture of isotopically labeled and unlabeled C sources (see Supplemental Note XX). We predicted the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number for each OTU as described previously <span class="citation">(5)</span>. The estimated <em>rrn</em> gene copy number for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders was inversely related to time point of the first response per OTU (P-value 2.02x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 15</sup></span>, Figure [fig:copy]). OTUs that did not respond at day 1 respond but did respond at day 3 and/or day 7 had fewer estimated <em>rrn</em> copy number than OTUs that responded at day 1 (Figure [fig:copy]).</p>
<p>We assessed phylogenetic clustering of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs with the Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) and the Net Relatedness Index (NRI). Briefly, positive NRI and NTI with corresponding low P-values indicates deep phylogenetic clustering whereas negative NRI with high P-values indicates taxa are overdispersed compared to the null model <span class="citation">(6)</span>. NRI and P-values for substrate responder groups suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are overdispersed (NRI: -1.33, P: 0.90) while <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders are clustered (NRI: 4.49, P: 0.001). NTI values show that both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are clustered near the tips of the tree (NTI: 1.43 (P: 0.072), 2.69 (P: 0.001), respectively).</p>
