<p>We observed C use dynamics by the soil microbial community by conducting a nucleic acid SIP experiment wherein xylose or cellulose carried the isotopic label. We set up three soil microcosm series. Each microcosm was amended with a C substrate mixture that included cellulose and xylose. The C substrate mixture approximated the chemical composition of freshly degrading plant biomass. The same substrate mixture was added to microcosms in each series, however, for each series except the control, one substrate was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C counterpart; <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose in one series, <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose in another, and no <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled substrates in the control. Microcosm amendments are shorthand identified in the following figures by the following code: “13CXPS” refers to the amendment with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (that is <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span><strong>C</strong> <strong>X</strong>ylose <strong>P</strong>lant <strong>S</strong>imulant), “13CCPS” refers to the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose amendment and “12CCPS” refers to the amendment that only contained <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C substrates (i.e. control). Xylose or cellulose were chosen to carry the isotopic label to contrast C assimilation for labile, soluble C (xylose) versus insoluble, polymeric C (cellulose). 5.3 mg of C substrate mixture per gram soil was added to each microcosm representing 18% of the total soil C. The mixture included 0.42 mg xylose-C and 0.88 mg cellulose-C g soil<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>. Microcosms were harvested for DNA extraction at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 during a 30 day incubation. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilation peaked immediately and tapered over the 30 day incubation whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose assimilation peaked two weeks after amendment additions(Figure [fig:ord]).</p>
<p>Microcosm DNA was density fractionated on CsCl density gradients. We assayed SSU rRNA gene content of CsCl gradient fractions using high-throughput DNA sequencing technology. We sequenced SSU rRNA gene amplicons from a total of 277 CsCl gradient fractions from 14 CsCl gradients and 12 bulk microcosm DNA samples. The SSU rRNA gene data set contained 1,102,685 total sequences. The average number of sequences per sample was 3,816 (sd 3,629) and 265 samples had over 1,000 sequences. We sequenced SSU rRNA gene amplicons from an average of 19.8 fractions per CsCl gradient (sd 0.57). The average density between fractions was 0.0040 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> The sequencing effort recovered a total of 5,940 OTUs. 2,943 of the total 5,940 OTUs were observed in bulk samples. We observed 33 unique phylum and 340 unique genus annotations.</p>
<h2 id="soil-microcosm-microbial-community-changes-with-time">Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time</h2>
<p>Bulk soil DNA sequencing revealed changes in the soil microcosm microbial community structure and membership correlated significantly with incubation time (Figure [fig:bulk<sub>o</sub>rd]B, p-value 0.23, R<span class="math"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span> 0.63, Adonis test <span class="citation">Reference 1</span>). The identity of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled substrate added to the microcosms did not significantly correlate with community structure and membership (p-value 0.35). Additionally, microcosm beta diversity was significantly less than gradient fraction beta diversity (p-value 0.003, “betadisper” function R Vegan package <span class="citation">Reference 2 (3)</span>). Twenty-nine OTUs significantly changed in relative abundance with time (“BH” adjusted p-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span>0.10, <span class="citation">Reference 4</span>) (Figure [fig:time]). OTUs that significantly increased in relative abundance with time included OTUs in the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em>, <em>Cyanobacteria</em>, <em>Chloroflexi</em> and <em>Acidobacteria</em>. OTUs that significantly decreased in relative abundance with time included OTUs in the <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Firmicutes</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> (Figure [fig:time]). <em>Proteobacteria</em> was the only phylum that had OTUs which increased significantly and OTUs that decreased significantly in abundance with time. If sequences were grouped by taxonomic annotations at the class level, only four classes significantly changed in abundance, <em>Bacilli</em> (decreased), <em>Flavobacteria</em> (decreased), <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> (decreased) and <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> (increased) (Figure [fig:time<sub>c</sub>lass]). Of the 29 OTUs that changed significantly in relative abundance with time, 14 are labeled substrate responders (Figure [fig:time]).</p>
<h2 id="otus-that-assimilated-13c-from-xylose">OTUs that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose</h2>
<p>Within the first 7 days of incubation approximately 63% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose was respired and only an additional 6% more was respired from day 7 to 30, as determined from isotopic analysis of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C remaining in the soil at each time point. At the end of the 30 day incubation 30% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from added xylose remained in the soils. The <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C remaining in the soil from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose addition was likely stabilized by assimilation into microbial biomass and/or microbial conversion into other forms of organic matter. It is also possible that some <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose remains unavailable to microbes due to abiotic interactions in soil <span class="citation">(5)</span>. An average 16% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose added was respired within the first 7 days, 38% by day 14, and 60% by day 30.</p>
<p>Isotope incorporation by an OTU is revealed by enrichment of the OTU in heavy CsCl gradient fractions containing <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled DNA relative to heavy fractions from control gradients containing no <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled DNA. We refer to OTUs that putatively incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA originally from an isotopically labeled substrate as substrate “responders”. At day 1, 84% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs belonged to <em>Firmicutes</em>, 11% to <em>Proteobacteria</em> and 5% to <em>Bacteroidetes</em>. <em>Firmicutes</em> responders decreased from 16 OTUs at day 1 to one OTU at day 3 while <em>Bacteroidetes</em> responders increased from one OTU at day 1 to 12 OTUs at day 3. The remaining day 3 responders are members of the <em>Proteobacteria</em> (26%) and the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (5%). Day 7 responders were 53% <em>Actinobacteria</em>, 40% <em>Proteobacteria</em>, and 7% <em>Firmicutes</em>. The identities of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders change with time. The numerically dominant <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder phylum shifts from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and then to <em>Actinobacteria</em> across days 1, 3 and 7 (Figure [fig:l2fc], Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]).</p>
<p>All of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders in the <em>Firmicutes</em> phylum are closely related (at least 99% sequence identity) to cultured isolates from genera that are known to form endospores (Table [tab:xyl]). Each <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder is closely related to isolates annotated as members of <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Paenibacillus</em> or <em>Lysinibacillus</em>. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predominantly closely related to <em>Flavobacterium</em> species (5 of 8 total responders) (Table [tab:xyl]). Only one <em>Bacteroidetes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder is not closely related to a cultured isolate, “OTU.183” (closest LTP BLAST hit, <em>Chitinophaca sp.</em>, 89.5% sequence identity, Table [tab:xyl]). OTU.183 shares high sequence identity with environmental clones derived from rhizosphere samples (accession AM158371, unpublished) and the skin microbiome (accession JF219881, <span class="citation">Reference 6</span>). Other <em>Bacteroidetes</em> responders share high sequence identities with canonical soil genera including <em>Dyadobacer</em>, <em>Solibius</em> and <em>Terrimonas</em>. Six of the 8 <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are in the <em>Micrococcales</em> order. One <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responding <em>Actinobacteria</em> OTU shares 100% sequence identity with <em>Agromyces ramosus</em> (Table [tab:xyl]). <em>A. ramosus</em> is a known predatory bacterium but is not dependent on a host for growth in culture <span class="citation">(7)</span>. It is not possible to determine the specific origin of assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C in a DNA-SIP experiment. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C can be passed down through trophic levels although heavy isotope representation in C pools targeted by cross-feeders and predators would be diluted with depth into the trophic cascade. It is possible, however, that the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled <em>Agromyces</em> OTU was assimilating <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C primarily by predation if the <em>Agromyces</em> OTU was selective enough with respect to its prey that it primarily attacked <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilating organisms.</p>
<h2 id="cellulose-otus">Cellulose OTUs</h2>
<p>Only 2 and 5 OTUs had incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30 42 and 39 OTUs incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose into biomass. A <em>Cellvibrio</em> and <em>Sandaracinaceae</em> OTU assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at day 3. Day 7 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders included the same <em>Cellvibrio</em> responder as day 3, a <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> OTU and three <em>Chloroflexi</em> OTUs. 50% of Day 14 responders belong to <em>Proteobacteria</em> (66% Alpha-, 19% Gamma-, and 14% Beta-) followed by 17% <em>Planctomycetes</em>, 14% <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, 10% <em>Chloroflexi</em>, 7% <em>Actinobacteria</em> and 2% cyanobacteria. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> OTUs began to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose at day 30 (13% of day 30 responders). Other day 30 responding phyla included <em>Proteobacteria</em> (30% of day 30 responders; 42% Alpha-, 42% Delta, 8% Gamma-, and 8% Beta-), <em>Planctomycetes</em> (20%), <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (20%), <em>Chloroflexi</em> (13%) and cyanobacteria (3%). <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, and <em>Chloroflexi</em> had relatively high numbers of responders with strong response across multiple time points (Figure [fig:l2fc]).</p>
<p><em>Proteobacteria</em> represent 46% of all <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding OTUs identified. <em>Cellvibrio</em> accounted for 3% of all proteobacterial <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding OTUs detected. <em>Cellvibrio</em> was one of the first identified cellulose degrading bacteria and was originally described by Winogradsky in 1929 who named it for its cellulose degrading abilities <span class="citation">(8)</span>. All <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding <em>Proteobacteria</em> share high sequence identity with 16S rRNA genes from sequenced cultured isolates (Table [tab:cell]) except for “OTU.442” (best cultured isolate match 92% sequence identity in the <em>Chrondomyces</em> genus, Table [tab:cell]) and “OTU.663” (best cultured isolate match outside <em>Proteobacteria</em> entirely, <em>Clostridium</em> genus, 89% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]). Some <em>Proteobacteria</em> responders share high sequence identity with isolates in genera known to possess cellulose degraders including <em>Rhizobium</em>, <em>Devosia</em>, <em>Stenotrophomonas</em> and <em>Cellvibrio</em>. One <em>Proteobacteria</em> OTU shares high sequence identity (100%) with a <em>Brevundimonas</em> cultured isolate. <em>Brevundimonas</em> has not previously been identified as a cellulose degrader, but has been shown to degrade cellouronic acid, an oxidized form of cellulose <span class="citation">(9)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, a cosmopolitan soil phylum often found in high abundance <span class="citation">(10)</span>, are hypothesized to degrade polysaccharides in many environments <span class="citation">(10–12)</span>. <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> comprise 16% of the total <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responder OTUs detected. 40% of <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders belong to the uncultured “FukuN18” family originally identified in freshwater lakes <span class="citation">(13)</span>. The strongest <em>Verrucomicrobial</em> responder OTU to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose shared high sequence identity (97%) with an isolate from Norway tundra soil <span class="citation">(14)</span> although growth on cellulose was not assessed for this isolate. Only one other <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding verrucomicrobium shared high DNA sequence identity with an isolate, “OTU.638” (Table [tab:cell]) with <em>Roseimicrobium gellanilyticum</em> (100% sequence identity) which has been shown to grow on soluble cellulose <span class="citation">(15)</span>. The remaining <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> responders did not share high sequence identity with any isolates (maximum sequence identity with any isolate 93%).</p>
<p><em>Chloroflexi</em> are known for metabolically dynamic lifestyles ranging from anoxygenic phototrophy to organohalide respiration <span class="citation">(16)</span>. Recent studies have focused on <em>Chloroflexi</em> roles in C cycling <span class="citation">(16–18)</span> and several <em>Chloroflexi</em> utilize cellulose <span class="citation">(16–18)</span>. Four closely related OTUs in an undescribed <em>Chloroflexi</em> lineage (closest matching isolate for all four OTUs: <em>Herpetosiphon geysericola</em>, 89% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]) responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:trees]). One additional OTU also from a poorly characterized <em>Chloroflexi</em> lineage (closest cultured isolate matched a proteobacterium at 78% sequence identity) responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:trees]).</p>
<p>Other notable <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders include a <em>Bacteroidetes</em> OTU that shares high sequence identity (99%) to <em>Sporocytophaga myxococcoides</em> a known cellulose degrader <span class="citation">(19)</span>, and three <em>Actinobacteria</em> OTUs that share high sequence identity (100%) with isolates. One of the three <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders is in the <em>Streptomyces</em>, a genus known to possess cellulose degraders, while the other two share high sequence identity to cultured isolates <em>Allokutzneriz albata</em> <span class="citation">(20, 21)</span> and <em>Lentzea waywayandensis</em> <span class="citation">(22, 23)</span>; neither isolate decomposes cellulose in culture. Nine <em>Planctomycetes</em> OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose but none are within described genera (closest cultured isolate match 91% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]) (Figure [fig:trees]). One <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responder is annotated as “cyanobacteria”. The cyanobacteria phylum annotation is misleading as the OTU is not closely related to any oxygenic phototrophs (closest cultured isolate match <em>Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus</em>, 95% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]). A sister clade to the oxygenic phototrophs classically annotated as “cyanobacteria” in SSU rRNA gene reference databases, but does not possess any known phototrophs, has recently been proposed to constitute its own phylum, “Melainabacteria” <span class="citation">Reference 24</span>; although, the phylogenetic position of “Melainabacteria” is debated <span class="citation">(25)</span>. The catalog of metabolic capabilities associated with cyanobacteria (or candidate phyla previously annotated as cyanobacteria) are quickly expanding <span class="citation">(24, 25)</span>. Our findings provide evidence for cellulose degradation within a lineage closely related to but apart from oxygenic phototrophs. Notably, polysaccharide degradation is suggested by an analysis of a “Melainabacteria” genome <span class="citation">(24)</span>. Although we highlight <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders that share high sequence identity with described genera, most <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders uncovered in this experiment are not closely related to cultured isolates (Table [tab:cell]).</p>
<h2 id="xylose-responders-are-more-abundant-members-of-the-soil-community-than-cellulose-responders">Xylose responders are more abundant members of the soil community than cellulose responders</h2>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based on relative abundance in bulk DNA SSU rRNA gene content than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders (Figure [fig:shift], p-value 0.00028). However, both abundant and rare OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:shift]). For instance, a <em>Delftia</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responder is fairly abundant in the bulk samples (“OTU.5”, Table [tab:cell]). OTU.5 was on average the 13th most abundant OTU in bulk samples. A <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder (“OTU.1040”, Table [tab:xyl]) has a mean relative abundance in bulk samples of 3.57x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 05</sup></span>. Two <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were not found in any bulk samples (“OTU.862” and “OTU.1312”, Table [tab:cell]). Of the 10 most abundant responders, 8 are <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders and 6 of these 8 are consistently among the 10 most abundant OTUs in bulk samples.</p>
<p>Responder abundances summed at phylum level generally increased for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:babund]) whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder abundances summed at the phylum level decreased over time for <em>Firmicutes</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> although <em>Proteobacteria</em> spiked at day 14 (Figure [fig:babund]). Bulk abundance trends are roughly consistent with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C assimilation.</p>
<h2 id="cellulose-degraders-exhibit-higher-substrate-specificity-than-xylose-utilizers">Cellulose degraders exhibit higher substrate specificity than xylose utilizers</h2>
<p>Cellulose responders exhibited a greater shift in buoyant density (BD) than xylose responders in response to isotope incorporation (Figure [fig:shift], p-value 1.8610x<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 06</sup></span>). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders shifted on average 0.0163 g/mL (sd 0.0094) whereas xylose responders shifted on average 0.0097 (sd 0.0094). For reference, 100% <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C DNA BD is 0.04 g/mL greater than the BD of its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C counterpart. DNA BD increases as its ratio of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C increases. An organism that only assimilates C into DNA from a <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C isotopically labeled source, will have a greater <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C:<span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C ratio in its DNA than an organism utilizing a mixture of isotopically labeled and unlabeled C sources. Upon labeling, DNA from an organism that incorporates exclusively <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C will increase in BD more than DNA from an organism that does not exclusively utilize isotopically labeled C. Therefore the magnitude DNA BD shifts indicate substrate specificity given our experimental design as only one substrate was labeled in each amendment. We measured density shift as the change in an OTU’s density profile center of mass between corresponding control and labeled gradients. BD shifts, however, should not be evaluated on an individual OTU basis as a small number of density shifts are observed for each OTU and the variance of the density shift metric at the level of individual OTUs is unknown. It is therefore more informative to compare density shifts among substrate responder groups. Further, density shifts are based on relative abundance profiles and would be distorted in comparison to density shifts based on absolute abundance profiles and should be interpreted with this transformation in mind. It should also be noted that there was overlap in observed density shifts between <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, suggesting that although cellulose degraders are generally more substrate specific than xylose utilizers, each responder group exhibits a range of substrate specificities (Figure [fig:shift]).</p>
<h2 id="estimated-rrn-gene-copy-number-in-substrate-responder-groups">Estimated rrn gene copy number in substrate responder groups</h2>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder estimated <em>rrn</em> gene copy number is inversely related time of first response (p-value 2.02x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 15</sup></span>, Figure [fig:copy]). OTUs that first respond at later time points have fewer estimated <em>rrn</em> copy number than OTUs that first respond earlier (Figure [fig:copy]). <em>rrn</em> copy number estimation is a recent advance in microbiome science <span class="citation">(26)</span> although the relationship of <em>rrn</em> copy number per genome with ecological strategy is well established <span class="citation">(27)</span>. Microorganisms with a high <em>rrn</em> copy number tend to be fast growers specialized to take advantage of boom-bust environments whereas microorganisms with low <em>rrn</em> copy number favor slower growth under lower and more consistent nutrient input <span class="citation">(27)</span>. At the beginning of our incubation, OTUs with estimated high <em>rrn</em> copy number or “fast-growers” assimilate xylose into biomass and with time slower growers (lower <em>rrn</em> copy number) begin to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose. Further, <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders have more estimated rRNA operon copy numbers per genome than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders (p-value 1.878x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 09</sup></span>) suggesting xylose respiring microbes are generally faster growers than cellulose degraders.</p>
