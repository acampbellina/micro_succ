<p>We observed C use dynamics in an agricultural soil microbial community by conducting a nucleic acid SIP experiment wherein xylose or cellulose carried the isotopic label. We set up three soil microcosm series. Each microcosm was amended with a C substrate mixture that included cellulose and xylose. The C substrate mixture approximated the C composition of fresh plant biomass. The same mixture was added to all microcosms, however, for each series except the control, xylose or cellulose was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C counterpart. Microcosm amendments are identified in figures by the following code: “13CXPS” refers to the amendment with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (<span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span><strong>C</strong> <strong>X</strong>ylose <strong>P</strong>lant <strong>S</strong>imulant), “13CCPS” refers to the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose amendment and “12CCPS” refers to the amendment that only contained <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C (i.e. control). 5.3 mg C substrate mixture per gram of soil was added to each microcosm representing 18% of the soil C. The mixture included 0.42 mg xylose-C and 0.88 mg cellulose-C per gram soil. Microcosms were harvested at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 during a 30 day incubation. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilation peaked immediately and tapered over the 30 day incubation whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose assimilation peaked two weeks after amendment additions(Figure [fig:ord], Figure [fig:rspndr<sub>c</sub>ount]). See Supplemental Note XX for sequencing and density fractionation statistics.</p>
<h2 id="soil-microcosm-microbial-community-changes-with-time">Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time</h2>
<p>Changes in the bulk soil microcosm microbial community structure and membership correlated significantly with incubation time (Figure [fig:bulk<sub>o</sub>rd]B, p-value 0.23, R<span class="math"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span> 0.63, Adonis test <span class="citation">(1)</span>). The identity of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled substrate added to the microcosms did not significantly correlate with bulk soil community structure and membership (p-value 0.35). Additionally, microcosm beta diversity was significantly less than gradient fraction beta diversity (p-value 0.003, “betadisper” function R Vegan package <span class="citation">(2, 3)</span>, Figure [fig:bulk<sub>o</sub>rd]). Twenty-nine OTUs significantly changed in relative abundance with time (“BH” adjusted p-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span>0.10, <span class="citation">(4)</span>) and of these 29 OTUs, 14 were labeled substrate responders (Figure [fig:time]). If sequences were grouped by taxonomic annotations at the class level, only four classes significantly changed in abundance, <em>Bacilli</em> (decreased), <em>Flavobacteria</em> (decreased), <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> (decreased) and <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> (increased) (Figure [fig:time<sub>c</sub>lass]).</p>
<p>Responder abundances summed at phylum level increased for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:babund]) whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder abundances summed at the phylum level decreased over time for <em>Firmicutes</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em> and <em>Proteobacteria</em> although <em>Proteobacteria</em> spiked at day 14 (Figure [fig:babund]).</p>
<h2 id="responders">OTUs that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA</h2>
<p>Within the first 7 days of incubation approximately 63% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose was respired and only an additional 6% more was respired from day 7 to 30. At day 30, 30% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose remained. An average 16% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose added was respired within the first 7 days, 38% by day 14, and 60% by day 30.</p>
<p>We refer to OTUs that putatively incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA originally from an isotopically labeled substrate as substrate “responders” (see Supplemental Note XX for “response” criteria). At day 1, 84% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs belonged to <em>Firmicutes</em>, 11% to <em>Proteobacteria</em> and 5% to <em>Bacteroidetes</em>. <em>Firmicutes</em> responders decreased from 16 OTUs at day 1 to one OTU at day 3 while <em>Bacteroidetes</em> responders increased from one OTU at day 1 to 12 OTUs at day 3. The remaining day 3 responders are members of the <em>Proteobacteria</em> (26%) and the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (5%). Day 7 responders were 53% <em>Actinobacteria</em>, 40% <em>Proteobacteria</em>, and 7% <em>Firmicutes</em>. The identities of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders changed with time. The numerically dominant <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder phylum shifted from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and then to <em>Actinobacteria</em> across days 1, 3 and 7 (Figure [fig:l2fc], Figure [fig:xyl<sub>c</sub>ount]).</p>
<p>Only 2 and 5 OTUs had incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30, 42 and 39 OTUs incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose into biomass. A <em>Cellvibrio</em> and <em>Sandaracinaceae</em> OTU assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at day 3. Day 7 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders included the same <em>Cellvibrio</em> responder as day 3, a <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> OTU and three <em>Chloroflexi</em> OTUs. 50% of Day 14 responders belong to <em>Proteobacteria</em> (66% Alpha-, 19% Gamma-, and 14% Beta-) followed by 17% <em>Planctomycetes</em>, 14% <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, 10% <em>Chloroflexi</em>, 7% <em>Actinobacteria</em> and 2% cyanobacteria. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> OTUs began to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose at day 30 (13% of day 30 responders). Other day 30 responding phyla included <em>Proteobacteria</em> (30% of day 30 responders; 42% Alpha-, 42% Delta, 8% Gamma-, and 8% Beta-), <em>Planctomycetes</em> (20%), <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (20%), <em>Chloroflexi</em> (13%) and cyanobacteria (3%). <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, and <em>Chloroflexi</em> had relatively high numbers of responders with strong response across multiple time points (Figure [fig:l2fc]).</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-13c-responders">Ecological strategies of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C responders</h2>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based on relative abundance in bulk DNA SSU rRNA gene content than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders (Figure [fig:shift], p-value 0.00028). However, both abundant and rare OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure [fig:shift]). Two <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were not found in any bulk samples (“OTU.862” and “OTU.1312”, Table [tab:cell]). Of the 10 most abundant responders, 8 are <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders and 6 of these 8 are consistently among the 10 most abundant OTUs in bulk samples.</p>
<p>Cellulose responders exhibited a greater shift in buoyant density (BD) than xylose responders in response to isotope incorporation (Figure [fig:c1], Figure [fig:shift], p-value 1.8610x<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 06</sup></span>). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders shifted on average 0.0163 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094) whereas xylose responders shifted on average 0.0097 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094). For reference, 100% <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C DNA BD is 0.04 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> greater than the BD of its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C counterpart. DNA BD increases as its ratio of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C increases. An organism that only assimilates C into DNA from a <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C isotopically labeled source, will have a greater <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C:<span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C ratio in its DNA than an organism utilizing a mixture of isotopically labeled and unlabeled C sources (see supplemental note XX).</p>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder estimated <em>rrn</em> gene copy number was inversely related time of first response (p-value 2.02x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 15</sup></span>, Figure [fig:copy]). OTUs that first respond at later time points have fewer estimated <em>rrn</em> copy number than OTUs that first respond earlier (Figure [fig:copy]).</p>
