\section{Results}
% Fakesubsubsection:We observed C use dynamics by the soil microbial
We observed C use dynamics in an agricultural soil microbial community by
conducting a nucleic acid SIP experiment wherein xylose or cellulose carried
the isotopic label. We set up three soil microcosm series. Each microcosm was
amended with a C substrate mixture that included cellulose and xylose. The
C substrate mixture approximated the C composition of fresh plant biomass. The
same mixture was added to all microcosms, however, for each
series except the control, xylose or cellulose was substituted for its $^{13}$C
counterpart. Microcosm amendments are identified in figures by the following
code: "13CXPS" refers to the amendment with $^{13}$C-xylose ($^{13}$\textbf{C}
\textbf{X}ylose \textbf{P}lant \textbf{S}imulant), "13CCPS" refers to the
$^{13}$C-cellulose amendment and "12CCPS" refers to the amendment that only
contained $^{12}$C (i.e. control). 5.3 mg C substrate mixture per gram of soil
was added to each microcosm representing 18\% of the soil C. The mixture
included 0.42 mg xylose-C and 0.88 mg cellulose-C per gram soil.
Microcosms were harvested at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 during a 30 day
incubation. $^{13}$C-xylose assimilation peaked immediately and tapered over
the 30 day incubation whereas $^{13}$C-cellulose assimilation peaked two weeks
after amendment additions(Figure~\ref{fig:ord}). See Supplemental~Note~XX for
sequencing and density fractionation statistics.

\subsection{Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time}
% Fakesubsubsection:Changes in the soil microcosm microbial community structure
Changes in the bulk soil microcosm microbial community structure and membership
correlated significantly with incubation time (Figure~\ref{fig:bulk_ord}B,
p-value 0.23, R$^{2}$ 0.63, Adonis test \citep{Anderson2001a}). The identity of
the $^{13}$C-labeled substrate added to the microcosms did not significantly
correlate with bulk soil community structure and membership (p-value 0.35).
Additionally, microcosm beta diversity was significantly less than gradient
fraction beta diversity (p-value 0.003, "betadisper" function R Vegan package
\citep{Anderson2006,oksanen2007vegan}, Figure~XX). Twenty-nine OTUs
significantly changed in relative abundance with time ("BH" adjusted p-value
$<$0.10, \citep{YBenjamini1995}) and of these 29 OTUs, 14 were labeled
substrate responders (Figure~\ref{fig:time}). If sequences were grouped by
taxonomic annotations at the class level, only four classes significantly
changed in abundance, \textit{Bacilli} (decreased), \textit{Flavobacteria}
(decreased), \textit{Gammaproteobacteria} (decreased) and
\textit{Herpetosiphonales} (increased) (Figure~\ref{fig:time_class}). 
   
% Fakesubsubsection:Responder abundances summed at phylum level generally increased
Responder abundances summed at phylum level increased for
$^{13}$C-cellulose (Figure~\ref{fig:babund}) whereas $^{13}$C-xylose
responder abundances summed at the phylum level decreased over time for
\textit{Firmicutes}, \textit{Bacteroidetes}, \textit{Actinobacteria} and
\textit{Proteobacteria} although \textit{Proteobacteria} spiked at day 14
(Figure~\ref{fig:babund}).

\subsection{OTUs that assimilated $^{13}$C into DNA} \label{responders}
% Fakesubsubsection:Within the first 7 days of incubation approximately 63\% 
Within the first 7 days of incubation approximately 63\% of $^{13}$C-xylose was
respired and only an additional 6\% more was respired from day 7 to 30. At day
30, 30\% of the $^{13}$C from xylose remained. An average 16\% of the
$^{13}$C-cellulose added was respired within the first 7 days, 38\% by day 14,
and 60\% by day 30.   

% Fakesubsubsection:Isotope incorporation by an OTU
We refer to OTUs that putatively incorporated $^{13}$C into DNA originally from
an isotopically labeled substrate as  substrate ``responders'' (see
Supplemental Note~XX for "response" criteria). At day 1, 84\% of
$^{13}$C-xylose responsive OTUs belonged to \textit{Firmicutes}, 11\% to
\textit{Proteobacteria} and 5\% to \textit{Bacteroidetes}. \textit{Firmicutes}
responders decreased from 16 OTUs at day 1 to one OTU at day 3 while
\textit{Bacteroidetes} responders increased from one OTU at day
1 to 12 OTUs at day 3. The remaining day 3 responders are members of the
\textit{Proteobacteria} (26\%) and the \textit{Verrucomicrobia} (5\%). Day
7 responders were 53\% \textit{Actinobacteria}, 40\% \textit{Proteobacteria},
and 7\% \textit{Firmicutes}. The identities of $^{13}$C-xylose responders
changed with time. The numerically dominant $^{13}$C-xylose responder phylum
shifted from \textit{Firmicutes} to \textit{Bacteroidetes} and then to
\textit{Actinobacteria} across days 1, 3 and 7 (Figure~\ref{fig:l2fc},
Figure~\ref{fig:xyl_count}). 

% Fakesubsubsection:Only 2 and 5 OTUs were found to
Only 2 and 5 OTUs had incorporated $^{13}$C from
$^{13}$C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30,
42 and 39 OTUs incorporated $^{13}$C from $^{13}$C-cellulose into
biomass. A \textit{Cellvibrio} and \textit{Sandaracinaceae} OTU assimilated
$^{13}$C from $^{13}$C-cellulose at day 3. Day 7 $^{13}$C-cellulose responders
included the same \textit{Cellvibrio} responder as day 3,
a \textit{Verrucomicrobia} OTU and three \textit{Chloroflexi} OTUs.  50\% of
Day 14 responders belong to \textit{Proteobacteria} (66\% Alpha-, 19\% Gamma-,
and 14\% Beta-) followed by 17\% \textit{Planctomycetes}, 14\%
\textit{Verrucomicrobia}, 10\% \textit{Chloroflexi}, 7\%
\textit{Actinobacteria} and 2\% cyanobacteria. \textit{Bacteroidetes} OTUs
began to incorporate $^{13}$C from cellulose at day
30 (13\% of day 30 responders). Other day 30 responding phyla included
\textit{Proteobacteria} (30\% of day 30 responders; 42\% Alpha-, 42\% Delta,
8\% Gamma-, and 8\% Beta-), \textit{Planctomycetes} (20\%),
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (20\%), \textit{Chloroflexi} (13\%) and
cyanobacteria (3\%). \textit{Proteobacteria}, \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, and
\textit{Chloroflexi} had relatively high numbers of responders with strong
response across multiple time points (Figure~\ref{fig:l2fc}).

\subsection{Ecological strategies of $^{13}$C responders}
% Fakesubsubsection:$^{13}$C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based
$^{13}$C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based on
relative abundance in bulk DNA SSU rRNA gene content than $^{13}$C-cellulose
responders (Figure~\ref{fig:shift}, p-value 0.00028).  However, both abundant
and rare OTUs responded to $^{13}$C-xylose and $^{13}$C-cellulose
(Figure~\ref{fig:shift}). Two $^{13}$C-cellulose responders were not found in
any bulk samples ("OTU.862" and "OTU.1312", Table~\ref{tab:cell}). Of the 10
most abundant responders, 8 are $^{13}$C-xylose responders and 6 of these 8 are
consistently among the 10 most abundant OTUs in bulk samples.

% Fakesubsubsection:Cellulose responders exhibited a greater shift in BD
Cellulose responders exhibited a greater shift in buoyant density (BD) than
xylose responders in response to isotope incorporation (Figure~\ref{fig:shift},
p-value 1.8610x$^{-06}$). $^{13}$C-cellulose responders shifted on average
0.0163 g mL$^{-1}$ (sd 0.0094) whereas xylose responders shifted on average
0.0097 g mL$^{-1}$ (sd 0.0094). For reference, 100\% $^{13}$C DNA BD is 0.04
g mL$^{-1}$ greater than the BD of its $^{12}$C counterpart. DNA BD increases
as its ratio of $^{13}$C to $^{12}$C increases. An organism that only
assimilates C into DNA from a $^{13}$C isotopically labeled source, will have
a greater $^{13}$C:$^{12}$C ratio in its DNA than an organism utilizing
a mixture of isotopically labeled and unlabeled C sources (see supplemental
note XX). 

% Fakesubsubsection:$^{13}$C-xylose responder estimated \textit{rrn} gene copy
$^{13}$C-xylose responder estimated \textit{rrn} gene copy number was
inversely related time of first response (p-value 2.02x10$^{-15}$,
Figure~\ref{fig:copy}). OTUs that first respond at later time points have
fewer estimated \textit{rrn} copy number than OTUs that first respond
earlier (Figure~\ref{fig:copy}).
