<p>We have a limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling yet soil contains a large fraction of the global C pool. Microorganisms mediate most soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the complexity of soil C biochemistry and the wide range of soil microorganisms participating in C reactions. We demonstrate C use dynamics by soil microbial taxa. Furthermore, we identified microorganisms involved in cellulose decomposition that were previously uncharacterized physiologically â€“ cellulose is the most globally abundant biopolymer. Our results expand knowledge of soil functional guild diversity and activity which reveal soil structure-function relationships. This study is a departure from typical nucleic acid SIP studies that focus on listing the identities of heavy isotope labeled organisms. Our approach enables DNA-SIP to identify <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms with greater resolution producing a better sampling of functional guilds. This not only allows us to connect function to genetic identity but also allows us to assess functional guild diversity and uncover ecological strategies. Further, we demonstrate how substrate specificity can be assessed from DNA-SIP data.</p>
