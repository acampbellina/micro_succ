<p>We have a limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling yet soil contains a large fraction of the global C pool. Microorganisms mediate most soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the complexity of soil C biochemistry and the wide range of soil microorganisms participating in C reactions. We demonstrate C use dynamics by soil microbial taxa. Furthermore, we identified microorganisms involved in cellulose decomposition that were previously uncharacterized physiologically â€“ cellulose is the most globally abundant biopolymer. Our results expand knowledge of soil functional guild diversity and activity which reveal soil structure-function relationships.</p>
