\section{Significance} 
We have limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling yet soil contains
a large fraction of the global C pool. Microorganisms mediate most soil
C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the complexity of soil
C biochemistry and the wide range of soil microorganisms participating in C reactions.
We demonstrate temporal C use dynamics in discrete soil microbial taxa. 
Furthermore, we identified novel microorganisms involved in cellulose
decomposition, the most globally abundant biopolymer. Further application of the
method demonstrated in this paper will identify microbial taxa that
mediate soil C transformations for more substrates and soils and increase our
understanding of global soil C cycling.
