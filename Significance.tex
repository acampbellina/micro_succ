\section{Significance} 
We have limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling dynamics despite the fact that the terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of global C. Microbial processes are responsible for the majority of soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the wide range of organisms participating in C reactions. We identified temporal C use dynamics in discrete soil microbial taxa. This sheds light on the temporal soil microbial community transitions associated with the biomass degradation process and is the first ever demonstration of simultaneously tracking multiple soil C substrate use dynamics \textit{ex situ}.
