The terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of global carbon (C), yet we have little understanding about belowground soil microbial C cycle dynamics and food webs. Previous stable isotope analyses have used single substrate additions, single time point sampling, pure cultures, or some combination thereof.  In this study we amend soils with a complex carbon mixture and sample over a time series. We are able to identify discrete microbial taxa utilizing \textsuperscript{13}C-xylose and \textsuperscript{13}C-cellulose from microbial community DNA using a novel approach, next generation sequencing enabled stable isotope probing. Results suggest clade or taxa level responses, but not phylum level substrate utilization as is often portrayed. Data also demonstrate labile versus polymeric C dynamics in soil.
