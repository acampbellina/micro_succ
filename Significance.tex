\section{Significance} 
The terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of global carbon (C), yet we have little understanding about belowground soil microbial C cycle dynamics and food webs. Previous stable isotope analyses have used single substrate additions, single time point sampling, pure cultures, or some combination thereof.  In this study we amend soils with a complex carbon mixture and sample over a time series. Using DNA from these soils, we are able to identify discrete microbial taxa utilizing \textsuperscript{13}C-xylose and \textsuperscript{13}C-cellulose using a novel approach, next generation sequencing enabled stable isotope probing.
