\section{Significance} Terrestrial C flux is largely mediated by microbial
metabolism in soils. Though global C models may be improved by incorporating
microbial physiological diversity, characterizing the ecophysiology of microbes
involved with C decomposition has proven difficult due to their overwhelming
diversity. We characterized C use dynamics of individual microbes in soil and
show that different C forms have distinct decomposition dynamics governed
by different microbial lineages. For example, specialized slow growing
microbes that belong to poorly characterized lineages found globally in
soils assimilated cellulose C into DNA in our experiment. Cellulose is the
most abundant biopolymer worldwide and these microbes may mediate
cellulose decomposition on a global scale. These results expand our
knowledge of the ecology of microbes that mediate major transformations of
terrestrial C in soils.
