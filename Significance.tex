\section{Significance} 
We have limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling dynamics despite the fact that the terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of the global C pool. Microbial processes are responsible for the majority of soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the wide range of organisms participating in C reactions. Using a mixture of C substrates, we identified temporal C use dynamics in discrete soil microbial taxa. This sheds light on the soil microbial community transitions associated with the biomass degradation process and is the first ever demonstration of simultaneously tracking distinct C substrate use dynamics of multiple C substrates through a soil microbial community \textit{ex situ}. Furthermore, we identified novel microorganisms involved in the decomposition of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer globally. Application of this method may help to identify microbial taxa that mediate soil C cycling and increase our understanding of soil C use dynamics.
