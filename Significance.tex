\section{Significance} 
The terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of global carbon (C), yet we have little understanding about belowground soil microbial C cycle dynamics and food webs. When organic C from plants reaches soil it is degraded through the activity of fungi and by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. This C may be rapidly returned to the atmosphere as CO\textsubscript{2} or may remain in the soil where it may persist for up to thousands of years. The majority of C is respired and on an annual basis soil respiration produces 10 times more CO2 than anthropogenic emissions (Chapin et al. 2002). Next generation sequencing enabled stable isotope probing is a novel approach that allows us to identify discrete microbial taxa utilizing a given 13C-labeled substrate amidst
