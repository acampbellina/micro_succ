\section{Significance} Soil microorganisms drive C flux through the terrestrial
biosphere and accounting for microbial physiological diversity improves global
C models. But, characterizing the ecophysiology of microbes involved with
C decomposition in soil has proven difficult due to their overwhelming
diversity. We characterized C use of microbial taxa in soil and show different
C forms have distinct decomposition dynamics governed by different microbial
lineages. For example, we found microbes belonging to poorly characterized but
cosmopolitan taxa in soils assimilated cellulose-C into DNA. These microbes may
drive cellulose decomposition on a global scale. We identify microbial lineages
engaging in labile and structural C decomposition and explore their ecological
properties.
