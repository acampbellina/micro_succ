\section{Significance} Soil microorganisms drive C flux through the terrestrial
biosphere. Though account for microbial physiological diversity improves global
C models, characterizing the ecophysiology of microbes involved with
C decomposition has proven difficult due to their overwhelming diversity. We
characterized C use dynamics of individual microbes in soil and show 
different C forms have distinct decomposition dynamics governed by different
microbial lineages. For example, in our experiment specialized slow growing
microbes belonging to poorly characterized lineages found in soils worldwide
assimilated cellulose C into DNA. These microbes may drive cellulose
decomposition on a global scale. These results expand our knowledge of the
ecology of microbes that govern major terrestrial C transformation in soils.
