\section{Significance} Terrestrial C flux is largely mediated by microbial
metabolism in soils. Characterizing the microbes involved with decomposition
has proven difficult due to their overwhelming diversity but understanding
microbial metabolism in soils may improve global C models. We characterized
C use dynamics of individual soil microbes and show that different C forms have
distinct decomposition dynamics governed by distinct microbial lineages. For
example, cellulose was decomposed by specialized slow growing microbes that
belong to poorly characterized lineages found globally in soils. Cellulose is
the most abundant biopolymer worldwide and these microbes may mediate cellulose
decomposition on a global scale. These results expand our knowledge of soil
functional guild diversity and activity which in turn inform soil structure
function relationships.
