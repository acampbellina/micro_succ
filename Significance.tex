\section{Significance} We have a limited understanding of soil carbon (C)
cycling yet soil contains a large fraction of the global C pool. Microorganisms
mediate most soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the
complexity of soil C biochemistry and the wide range of soil microorganisms
participating in C reactions. We demonstrate C use dynamics by soil microbial
taxa. Furthermore, we identified microorganisms involved in cellulose
decomposition that were previously uncharacterized physiologically -- cellulose
is the most globally abundant biopolymer. Our results expand knowledge of soil
functional guild diversity and activity which reveal soil function-structure
relationships.
