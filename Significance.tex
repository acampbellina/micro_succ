\section{Significance} Soil microorganisms drive C flux through the terrestrial
biosphere, and while accounting for microbial physiological diversity improves
global C models, characterizing the ecophysiology of microbes involved with
C decomposition has proven difficult due to their overwhelming diversity. We
characterized C use of individual microbes in soil and show different C forms
have distinct decomposition dynamics governed by different microbial lineages.
For example, we found microbes belonging to poorly characterized but
cosmopolitan taxa in soils assimilated cellulose C into DNA. These microbes may
drive cellulose decomposition on a global scale. We identify microbial lineages
engaging in labile and structural C decomposition and explore their ecological
properties.
