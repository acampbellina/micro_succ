<p><em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, cosmopolitan soil microbes <span class="citation">(1)</span>, can comprise up to 23% of 16S rRNA gene sequences in high-throughput DNA sequencing surveys of SSU rRNA genes in soil <span class="citation">(1)</span> and can account for up to 9.8% of soil 16S rRNA <span class="citation">(2)</span>. Many <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> were first isolated in the last decade <span class="citation">Reference 3</span> but only one of the 15 most abundant verrucomicrobial phylotypes in a global soil sample collection shared greater than 93% sequence identity with a cultured isolate <span class="citation">(1)</span>. Genomic analyses and physiological profiling of <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> isolates revealed <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> are capable of methanotrophy, diazotrophy, and cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(3, 4)</span>, yet the function of soil <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> in global C-cycling remains unknown. Only two of the ten putative cellulose degrading <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> identified in this experiment share at least 95% sequence identity with an isolate (“OTU.83” and “OTU.627”, Table [tab:cell]). Seven of ten <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding verrucomicrobial OTUs were classified as <em>Spartobacteria</em> which are a numerically dominant family of <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> in SSU rRNA gene surveys of 181 globally distributed soil samples <span class="citation">(1)</span>. Given their ubiquity and abundance in soil as well as their demonstrated incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> lineages, particularly <em>Spartobacteria</em>, may be important contributors to cellulose decomposition on a global scale.</p>
<p>Cellulose degrading soil <em>Chloroflexi</em> have previously been identified in DNA-SIP studies <span class="citation">(5)</span>. The cellulose degrading <em>Chloroflexi</em> in this study are only distantly related to isolates [tab:cell]. Chloroflexi are among the six most abundant soil phyla commonly recovered soil microbial diversity surveys <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Chloroflexi are typically not as as abundant as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> but are roughly as abundant as <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em> <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Four of five <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive <em>Chloroflexi</em> identified in this study are annotated as belonging to the <em>Herpetosiphon</em> although they share less than 95% sequence identity with their closest cultured relative in the <em>Herpetosiphon</em> genus (<em>H. geysericola</em>). <em>H. geysericola</em> is a predatory bacterium shown to prey upon <em>Aerobacter</em> in culture and can also digest cellulose <span class="citation">(7)</span>. In our study, “Herpetosiphon” <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders did not show a delayed response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose as compared to other responders but nonetheless could have become labeled by feeding on primary <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose degraders. The prey specificity of predatory bacteria is not well established especially <em>in situ</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling would be positively correlated with prey specificity. If the predator specifically preyed upon one population then it could take on the same labeling percent as that population given enough generations. Preying on multiple types would produce a mixed and dilute labeling signature if some of the prey were not isotopically labeled.</p>
<p>We also observed <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-incorporation from cellulose by <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em>. Strains in <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have all been previously implicated in cellulose degradation. <em>Planctomycetes</em> is the least studied of the three phyla and only one <em>Planctomycetes</em> isolate can grow on cellulose. None of the seven <em>Planctomycetes</em> cellulose degraders identified in this experiment are closely related to isolates. <em>Acidobacteria</em> did not pass or operational criteria for assessing <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation from cellulose into DNA in our microcosms. <em>Acidobacteria</em> have been found to degrade cellulose in culture CITE and are a numerically significant soil phylum CITE. <em>Acidobacteria</em> have been shown to dominate at low nutrient availability (CITE: cederlund 2014), which may explain why they were not active upon nutrient additions. The <em>Acidobacteria</em> in our microcosms were mainly annotated as belonging to candidate orders in the Silva taxonomic nomenclature. The highest relative abundance for any <em>Acidobacteria</em> order in the bulk samples was 0.20 (order “DA023”) and the highest relative abundance of the Acidobacteria phylum was 0.23.</p>
