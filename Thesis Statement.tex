\textbf{Thesis Statements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Paper demonstrates succession hypothesis of decomposition
     
     - PCoA
\item Demonstrates different microbes consume different carbon substrates
\item demonstrates how stable isotope probing can be utilized to determine what microbes are consuming specific subsrates
\item Show prevalence in Sean's fields to demonstrate ecological importance
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Figures}
\begin{itemize}
\item PCoA (all treatments, all days)
\item Carbon Utilization charts for top 10 responders to 13C for each treatment
\item Supplementary
      
      - isotopic analysis over time (table)

      - Relative abundance of 13C responders in bulk community over time

      - 12C and 13C density gradient graphs for each time point
