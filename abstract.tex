The contributions of specific microbial taxa to carbon (C) cycling in soil systems is poorly characterized and depends heavily on the need for enrichment and isolation. We employed a food web mapping approach in which a C mixture simulating soil organic matter was added to soil microcosms. In this approach, constituents of the added C mixture are systematically replaced with their 13C-labeled equivalents. Initial treatments included C mixtures that were either unlabeled or incorporated a 13C-xylose or 13C-cellulose label. Using CsCl gradient fractionation, incorporation of 13C into DNA was measured over a period of 30 days. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from all CsCl gradient fractions were characterized by 454 pyrosequencing and classified into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU). Incorporation of 13C from xylose into OTUs was observed at days 3, 7, and 14, while incorporation of 13C from cellulose was observed only after day 14.
