\subsection{Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time}
Using a distance metric that incorporates relative abundance information
(weighted Unifrac metric, \citep{Lozupone_2005}), 
time was significantly correlated to bulk sample phylogenetic profile variation (p-value
0.23, R$^{2}$ 0.63, Figure~\ref{fig:bulk_ord}) but the contrast between only
$^{12}$C additions with additions that included isotopically labeled substrates
was not (p-value 0.35). Additionally, bulk sample beta diversity was significantly
less than gradient fraction beta diversity (p-value 0.003).
