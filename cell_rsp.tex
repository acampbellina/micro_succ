\subsection{$^{13}$C-cellulose incorporating OTUs} 
Only 2 and 5 OTUs were found to have incorporated $^{13}$C from
$^{13}$C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30, however,
42 and 39 OTUs were found to incorporate $^{13}$C from $^{13}$C-cellulose into
biomass. An average 16\% of the $^{13}$C-cellulose added was respired within
the first 7 days, 38\% by day 14, and 60\% by day 30.  A \textit{Cellvibrio}
and \textit{Sandaracinaceae} OTU assimilated $^{13}$C from $^{13}$C-cellulose
at day 3. Day 7 $^{13}$C-cellulose responders included the same
\textit{Cellvibrio} responder as day 3, a \textit{Verrucomicrobia} OTU and
three \textit{Chloroflexi} OTUs.  50\% of Day 14 responders belong to
\textit{Proteobacteria} (66\% Alpha-, 19\% Gamma-, and 14\% Beta-) followed by
17\% \textit{Planctomycetes}, 14\% \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, 10\%
\textit{Chloroflexi}, 7\% \textit{Actinobacteria} and 2\% cyanobacteria.
\textit{Bacteroidetes} OTUs begin to incoporate $^{13}$C from cellulose at day
30 (13\% of day 30 responders). Other day 30 responding phyla include
\textit{Proteobacteria} (30\% of day 30 responders; 42\% Alpha-, 42\% Delta,
8\% Gamma-, and 8\% Beta-), \textit{Planctomycetes} (20\%),
\textit{Verrucomicrobia} (20\%), \textit{Chloroflexi} (13\%) and cyanobacteria
(3\%). \textit{Proteobacteria}, \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, and
\textit{Chloroflexi} had relatively high numbers of responders with
strong response across multiple time points (Figure~\ref{fig:l2fc}).
