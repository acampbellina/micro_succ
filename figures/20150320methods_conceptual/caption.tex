An organic matter enrichment including C components and nutrients commonly foundin plant biomass was added to soil microcosms. At days1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 replicate microcosms were destructively harvested. Bulk DNA from each treatment and time point(n = 14) was subjected to CsCl density gradient centrifugation and density gradientswere fractionated (orange tubes wherein each arrow represents a fraction from the density gradient).SSU rRNA genes were PCR amplified and sequenced from gradient fractions andfrom non-fractionated DNA (representing the bulk soil microbial community).
