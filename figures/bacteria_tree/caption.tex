\textbf{Figure 4.} Phylogenetic tree of sequences passing a user defined sparcity threshold (threshold# here) for at least one day of the time series. Branches are colored by phylum. \textsuperscript{13}C-responders for cellulose (blue) and xylose (green) are indicated by a point beside the respective branch. Heatmap demonstrates log\textsubscript{2} fold change of each taxa through the full time series for both treatments (cellulose, left; xylose, right).
