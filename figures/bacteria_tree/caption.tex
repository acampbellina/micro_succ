Phylogenetic tree of sequences passing a user defined
sparcity threshold (0.6) for at least one day of the time series. Branches are
colored by phylum. $^{13}$C-responders for cellulose (blue) and xylose (green)
are indicated by a point beside the respective branch. Heatmap demonstrates
log$_{2}$ fold change of each taxa through the full time series for
both treatments (cellulose, left; xylose, right).
