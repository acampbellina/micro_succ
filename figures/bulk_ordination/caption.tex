NMDS analysis of SSU rRNA gene composition differences between non-fractionated DNA alone (right panel) and in the context of SIP gradientfractions (left panel). Non-fractionated DNA SSU rRNA gene composition changedwith time but not with treatment (right panel) and variance of non-fractionatedDNA SSU rRNA gene composition was much less than variance introduced by densityfractionation (left panel). Distance in SSU rRNA gene composition wasquantified with the weighted UniFrac metric.
