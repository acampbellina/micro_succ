Change in relative abundance in non-fractionated DNA over time for xylose
responders (13CXPS) and cellulose responders (13CCPS). Each panel represents
a responders to the indicated substrate (i.e. cellulose (13CCPS) or xylose (13CXPS)) 
within the indicated phylum except for the lower right panel which shows all reponders to both
xylose and celluose. The abbreviations Proteo., Verruco., and Plancto.,
correspond to \textit{Proteobacteria}, \textit{Verrucomicrobia}, and \textit{Planctomycetes},
respectively.
