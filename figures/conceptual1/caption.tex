Density profile for a single cellulose responder in the $^{13}$C-cellulose
treatment (blue) and control (orange). Vertical lines show center of mass for
each density profile and the arrow denotes the magnitude and direction of
$\Delta\hat{BD}$. Right panel shows relative abundance values in the high
density fractions (The boxplot line is the median value. The box spans one
interquartile range (IR) about the median, whiskers extend 1.5 times the IR.
