Density profile for a single non-responder OTU. The $^{13}$C-cellulose treatment is inblue and the control treatment is in orange. The Vertical line showswhere "heavy" fractions begin as defined in our analysis. The right panelshows relative abundance values in the heavy fractions for each gradient(The boxplot line is the median value. The box spans one interquartilerange (IR) about the median, whiskers extend 1.5 times the IR and the dotsindicate outlier values beyond 1.5 times the IR).
