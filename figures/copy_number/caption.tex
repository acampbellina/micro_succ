Estimated rRNA operon copy number for xylose and cellulose responders. Theleftmost panel contrasts estimated \textit{rrn} copy number for cellulose (13CCPS) and xylose (13CXPS) responders. The right panel shows estimated \textit{rrn} copy numberversus time of first response for xylose responders. Colors denote the phylumof the OTUs (see legend).
