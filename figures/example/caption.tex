Raw data from example responders highlighted in the main text. The left columnshows DNA-SIP density fraction relative abundances for $^{13}$C-xylose or$^{13}$C-cellulose gradients in addition to control gradients for each of thechosen OTUs. Time is indicated by the color of the relative abundance profile(see legend). Gradient profiles are shaded by treatment where orange represents``control'' profles, blue ``$^{13}$C-cellulose'', and green``$^{13}$C-xylose.'' The right column shows the relative abundance of each OTUin non-fractionated DNA (i.e. the DNA that was subsequently fractionated on thedensity gradient). Enrichment in the heavy end of the gradient in $^{13}$Ctreatments indicates an OTU has $^{13}$C-labeled DNA.
