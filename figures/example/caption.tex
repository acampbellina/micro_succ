The left column shows DNA-SIP density fraction relative abundances for all gradients for each of the OTUs. Gradient profiles are shaded by treatment whereorange represents ``control'' profles, blue ``$^{13}$C-cellulose'', and green ``$^{13}$C-xylose.'' The right columnshows the abundance of each OTU in non-fractionated DNA (i.e. the DNA that was subsequently fractionated on thedensity gradient). Enrichment in the heavy end of the gradient in $^{13}$C treatments indicatesan OTU has $^{13}$C-labeled DNA that is greater in buoyant density than it would be unlabeled.
