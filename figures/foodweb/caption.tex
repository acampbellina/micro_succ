Conceptual model of soil food web in this experiment. Taxa shown possessed at least two $^{13}$C responder OTUs for a given C substrate. \textit{Proteobacteria} response was too varied taxonomically to depict at higher taxonomic resolution in this format. Black arrows indicate possible predator/prey interactions whereas colored arrows represent possible routes of primary degradation (green: xylose, blue: cellulose).
