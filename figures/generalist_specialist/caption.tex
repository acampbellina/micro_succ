Maximum enrichment at any point in time in heavy fractions of$^{13}$C-treatments relative to control (expressed as LFC) shown for$^{13}$C-cellulose versus $^{13}$C-xylose treatments. Each point represents anOTU. Blue points are cellulose responders, green xylose responders, and red areresponders to both xylose and cellulose, Grey points are OTUs that did notrepspond to either substrate. Line indicates a slope of one.
