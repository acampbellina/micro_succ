FigX.  PCoA (or NMDS) ordination plot of 454 sequence data from SIP fractions of each treatment over time.  Each point is representative of the bacterial community for a single fraction; density of fraction represented by diameter of the data point.  (A) NMDS colored by treatment; (B) same NMDS colored by day.
