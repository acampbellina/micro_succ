Enrichment of OTUs in either $^{13}$C-cellulose (13CCPS, upper panels) or
$^{13}$C-xylose (13CXPS, bottom panels) treatments relative to control,
expressed as LFC (see Methods). Each point indicates the LFC for a single OTU.
High enrichment values indicate an OTU is likely $^{13}$C-labeled. Different
colors represent different phyla and different panels represent different days.
The final column shows the frequency distribution of LFC values in each row.
Within each panel, shaded areas are used to indicate one standard deviation
(dark shading) or two standard deviations (light shading) about the mean of all
LFC values.
