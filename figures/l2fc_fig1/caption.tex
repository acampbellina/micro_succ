\textbf{Figure 2.}  Log\textsubscript{2} fold change of \textsuperscript{13}C-responders in cellulose treatment (top) and xylose treatment (bottom).  Log\textsubscript{2} fold change is based on the relative abundance in the experimental treatment compared to the control with the density range 1.7125-1.755 g/ml. Taxa are colored by phylum. 'Counts' is a histogram of number of sequences for each log\textsubscript{2} fold change value.    

Using fractions from within a density range of 1.7125-1.755 gmL\textsuperscript{-1}, relative abundances of taxa in the experimental treatments were compared to their respective relative abundances in the control treatment to calculate the log\textsubscript{2} fold change (Fig2).
