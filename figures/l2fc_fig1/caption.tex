Log$_{2}$ fold change of $^{13}$C-responders in cellulose
treatment (top) and xylose treatment (bottom).  Log$_{2}$ fold change is based
on the relative abundance in the experimental treatment compared to the control
within the density range 1.7125-1.755 g ml$^{-1}$. Taxa are
colored by phylum. The last column shows the distribution of all fold change values in each row. The darker gray band represents one standard deviation and the lighter band represents two standard deviations about the mean of all fold change values for both treatments.
