Log$_{2}$ fold change of $^{13}$C-responders in cellulose
treatment (top) and xylose treatment (bottom).  Log$_{2}$ fold change is based
on the relative abundance in the experimental treatment compared to the control
within the density range 1.7125-1.755 g ml$^{-1}$. Taxa are
colored by phylum. 'Counts' is a histogram of number of sequences for each
log$_{2}$ fold change value.
