OTU enrichment in $^{13}$C-treatment heavy density fractions relative to
control expressed as LFC (see Methods) for the $^{13}$C-cellulose treatment
(top) and $^{13}$C-xylose treatment (bottom). High LFC indicate the OTU
incorporated $^{13}$C into DNA (each point represents an OTU LFC for the given
treatment relative to control at the day indicated). Different colors
represent different phyla and different panels represent different days. The
final column shows the frequency distribution of LFC values in each row. Within
each panel, shaded areas are used to indicate LFC plus or minus one standard
deviation (dark shading) or two standard devations (light shading) about the
mean of all LFC values.
