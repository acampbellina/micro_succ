Change in non-fractionated DNA relative abundance versus time (expressed
as LFC) for OTUs that changed significantly over time (P-value $<$ 0.10, Wald test).
Each panel shows one phylum (labeled on the right). The taxonomic class is
indicated on the left. OTUs that responded to just xylose are shown in 
green, just cellulose in blue, and both xylose and cellulose in red.
