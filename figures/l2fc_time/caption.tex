Change in non-fractionated DNA relative abundance versus time (expressed
as LFC) for OTUs that changed significantly over time (P-value $<$ 0.10, Wald test).
Each panel shows one phylum (labeled on the right). The taxonomic class is
indicated on the left. Colors represent results shown in Figure 2 and
Figure 3.  OTUs that responded to just xylose are shown in 
green, just cellulose in blue, and both xylose and cellulose in red.
