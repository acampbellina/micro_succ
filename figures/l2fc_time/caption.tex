Change in non-fractionated DNA relative abundance versus time (expressed asLFC) for OTUs that changed significantly (P-value $<$ 0.10, Wald test). Eachpanel shows one phylum (labeled on the right). The taxonomic class is indicatedon the left. Colors represent whether OTUs responded to just xylose (green),just cellulose (blue), or both xylose and cellulose (red).
