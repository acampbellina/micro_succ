\textbf{Figure 1.} NMDS ordination plot of 454 sequence data from SIP fractions of each treatment over time. Each point is representative of the bacterial community sequence library for a single fraction; density of fraction represented by diameter of the data point. (A) NMDS colored by treatment; (B) same NMDS colored by day.
Twenty fractions from a CsCl gradient fractionation for each treatment at each time point were sequenced (Fig. S1). Using NMDS analysis from weighted unifrac distances, the relationship between microbial communities at each buoyant density from all treatments and time points are plotted (Fig 1).  Each point on the NMDS represents the microbial community based on 16S sequencing from a single fraction where the size of the point is representative of the denisty of that fraction and the colors represent the treatments (Fig1A) or days (Fig1B).
