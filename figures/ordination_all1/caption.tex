NMDS analysis of SIP gradient fraction SSU rRNA gene sequence composition reveals
differences in the sequence composition of gradient fractions is correlated to
fraction density, isotopic labeling, and time. SSU rRNA gene compositon was
profiled for fractions for each density gradient. $^{13}$C-labeling of DNA is
apparent because the SSU rRNA gene composition of gradient fractions from
$^{13}$C and control treatments differ at high density. Each point on the NMDS
plot represents one gradient fraction. SSU rRNA gene composition differences
between gradient fractions were quantified by the weighted Unifrac metric. The
size of each point is positively correlated with density and colors indicate
the treatment (A) or day (B).
