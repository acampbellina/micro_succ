\textbf{Figure 3.}  Topography of ^{13}C-responders based on their density shift (A) and rank (B). Kernel density estimation of \textsuperscript{13}C-responder's density shift in cellulose treatment (blue) and xylose treatment (green) demonstrates degree of labeling for responders for each respective substrate. \textsuperscript{13}C-responders in rank abundance are labeled by substrate (cellulose, blue; xylose, green) and the phylum which it belongs to.
