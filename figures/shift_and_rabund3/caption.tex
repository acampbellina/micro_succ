Characteristics of xylose responders (green) and cellulose responders (blue)
based on estimated \textit{rrn} copy number (A), $\Delta\hat{BD}$ (B), and
relative abundance in non-fractionated DNA (C). The estimated \textit{rrn} copy
number of all responders is shown versus time (A). Kernel density histogram of
$\Delta\hat{BD}$ values shows cellulose responders had higher average
$\Delta\hat{BD}$ than xylose responders indicating higher average atom \%
$^{13}$C in OTU DNA (B). The final panel indicates the rank relative abundance
of all OTUs observed in the non-fractionated DNA (C) where rank was determined
at day 1 (bold line) and relative abundance for each OTU is indicated for all
days by colored lines (see legend). Xylose responders (green ticks) have higher
relative abundance in non-fractionated DNA than cellulose responders (green ticks). 
All ticks are based on day 1 relative abundance.
