$^{13}$C-responder characteristics based on density shift (A) and rank (B).
Kernel density estimation of $^{13}$C-responder's density shift in cellulose
treatment (blue) and xylose treatment (green) demonstrates degree of labeling
for responders for each respective substrate. $^{13}$C-responders in rank
abundance are labeled by substrate (cellulose, blue; xylose, green). Ticks at top indicate
location of $^{13}$C-cylose responders in bulk community. Ticks at bottom indicate location of
$^{13}$C-cellulose responders in bulk community. OTU rank was assessed from day 1 bulk samples.
