Phylogenetic relationships of OTUs passing independent filtering when quantifyingOTU enrichment in heavy gradient fractions relative to control (see Methods). Onlythose phyla that contain responders are shown. Colored dots are used to identifyxylose responders (green) and cellulse responders (blue). The heatmaps indicateenrichment in high denstiy fractions relative to control (represented as LFC)for each OTU in response to both $^{13}$C-cellulose (``13CCPS'', leftmostheatmap) and $^{13}$C-xylose (``13CXPS'', rightmost heatmap) with values fordifferent days in each heatmap column. Greater enrichment (represented as LFC)in heavy density fractions provide evidence of $^{13}$C-labeled DNA.
