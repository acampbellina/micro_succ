Phylogenetic position of cellulose responders and xylose responders in the context of all OTUs that passed 
sparsity independent filtering criteria (see Methods). Only those phyla that contain responders are shown.
Colored dots are used to identify xylose responders (green) and cellulose
responders (blue). The heatmaps indicate enrichment in high denstiy fractions
relative to control (represented as LFC) for each OTU in response to both
$^{13}$C-cellulose (13CCPS, leftmost heatmap) and $^{13}$C-xylose
(13CXPS, rightmost heatmap) with values for different days in each heatmap
column. High enrichment values (represented as LFC) provide evidence of $^{13}$C-labeled DNA.
