Xylose reponders in the \textit{Actinobacteria}, \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Firmicutes} exhibit distinct temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-labeling.
The left column shows counts of $^{13}$C-xylose responders in the
\textit{Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes} and \textit{Proteobacteria}
at days 1, 3, 7 and 30. The right panel shows enrichment in high density
gradient fractions (expressed as fold change, not logarithmic) for responders
(large points) as well as a boxplot for the distribution of fold change values
(small dots are outliers, i.e. beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range (IR).
Whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IR, and the box extends one IR about the
median (solid line)). Each day in the right column shows all responders (i.e.
OTUs that responded to xylose at any point in time). Greater enrichment in high
density fractions of $^{13}$C-xylose treatment relative to control indicates
DNA is $^{13}$C-labeled.
