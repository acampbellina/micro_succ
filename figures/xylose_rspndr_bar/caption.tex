Xylose reponders in the \textit{Actinobacteria}, \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Firmicutes} exhibit distinct temporal dynamics of $^{13}$C-labeling.
The left column shows counts of $^{13}$C-xylose responders in the
\textit{Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes} and \textit{Proteobacteria}
at days 1, 3, 7 and 30. The right panel shows OTU enrichment in high density
gradient fractions (gray points, expressed as fold change) for responders
as well as a boxplot for the distribution of fold change values
(The box extends one interquartile range, whiskers extend 1.5 times
the IR, and small dots are outliers (i.e. beyond 1.5 times the IR)).
Each day in the right column shows all responders (i.e.
OTUs that responded to xylose at any point in time). High enrichment values 
indicates OTU DNA is likely $^{13}$C-labeled.
