How we propose to better this issue

With the rapid advancement and declining costs of high throughput sequencing, it has become increasingly easier to probe microbial communities.  In this study, we couple stable-isotope probing with 454 pyrosequencing in order to better understand organic matter decomposition dynamics as a function of soil microbial community C utilization. Overall, changes in microbial community composition over time is consistent with C decomposition being accompanied by a microbial community succession.
