\section{Introduction}
While a great deal of progress has been made in defining the flow of elements and energy through above-ground food webs, and progress has been made in characterizing detritivore food webs, we have only the most basic understanding of how matter and energy flows through microbial communities in soil. This deficiency is driven by the staggering complexity of soil microbial food webs and the opacity of these biological systems to current methods for describing the activities of soil microorganisms. Progress has been made in relating community composition to ecosystem function for certain microbial processes in soils, such as nitrification and denitrification, which are mediated by defined functional groups. Carbon-cycling processes, however, have proven more recalcitrant to study due to the wide range of organisms participating in these reactions.
 
There are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) stored in soils worldwide, excluding plant biomass, which accounts for $\sim$80\% of the global terrestrial C pool \cite{Amundson_2001,Mendelsohn_2001,IPCC2007Synth,elsen_Ayres_Wall_Bardgett_2011,Lal_2008,BATJES_1996,Lal_2008}. When organic C from plants reaches soil it is degraded through the activity of fungi and bacteria. This C may be rapidly returned to the atmosphere as CO\textsubscript{2} or may remain in the soil as humic substances that may persist up to 2000 years (Yanagita 1990). The majority of C is respired and on an annual basis soil respiration produces 10 times more CO\textsubscript{2} than anthropogenic emissions (Chapin et al. 2002). Global changes in atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2}, temperature, and ecosystem nitrogen inputs, are expected to impact primary production and C inputs to soils (van Groenigen et al. 2006), but it remains difficult to predict the response of soil processes to anthropogenic change (Davidson et al. 2006). Current climate change models concur on atmospheric and ocean C predictions but not terrestrial \cite{Friedlingstein_2006}. The disagreeable predictive power between models for terrestrial ecosystems reflects how little we know about belowground C cycling dynamics. It is estimated that 80-90\% of the C cycling in soil is mediated by microorganisms \cite{ColemanCrossley_1996,Nannipieri_2003}. Understanding microbial processing of nutrients in soils presents a special challenge due to the hetergeneous nature of soil ecosystems and our limitations in methodologies. Soils consist of an overwhelming biological, chemical, and physical complexity which affects microbial community composition, diversity, and structure (refs). Confounding factors such as physical protection/aggregation, moisture content, pH, temperature, frequency and type of land disturbance, soil history, mineralogy, N quality and availability, and litter quality have all been shown to affect the ability of the soil microbial community to access and metabolize C substrates \cite{Schlesinger_1977,dgett_Wall_Hattenschwiler_2010,Sollins_Homann_Caldwell_1996,Torn_Vitousek_Trumbore_2005,TRUMBORE_2006,Schimel_2012}. Furthermore, rates of metabolism are often measured without knowing the identity of the microbial species specifically involved \cite{ndi_Pietramellara_Renella_2003} resulting in uncertainty in importance of community diversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning \cite{Allison_2008,ndi_Pietramellara_Renella_2003,Schimel_2012}. 

The first step in teasing out belowground C cycling dynamics is to identify microbial groups responsible for the measured process and understand the relationship between genetic diversity, community structure, and function \cite{O_Donnell_2002}. Stable-isotope probing (SIP) provides a unique opportunity to link microbial identity to activity \cite{Chen_Murrell_2010}. SIP has been utilized to expand our knowledge of a myriad of important biogeochemical processes \cite{Chen_Murrell_2010}, yet, there remain limitations. Frequently utilized SIP-coupled molecular applications such as TRFLP, DGGE, and cloning provide insufficient resolution of taxon identity and depth of coverage and, to our knowledge, are usually conducted under the narrow scope of single substrate additions with few exceptions \cite{Lueders_2003,Chauhan_2009}. SIP studies use single substrate experimental designs to minimize isotope signal dilution, however, it detracts from how microbes may experience that substrate naturally, calling into question its environmental and biological relevance.

Degradative succession refers to the temporal changes in species or functional guilds that occurs during the sequential degradation of constituents of a nutrient resource \cite{townsend2003essentials,Bastian_2009}. The decomposition of a nutrient source is hypothesized to promote succession of active community members as compounds are sequentially degraded \cite{Biddanda_1988}. C in plant biomass is found primarily in cellulose (30-50\%), hemicellulose (20-40\%), and lignin (15-25\%) (Lynd et al. 2002). Hemicellulose is composed mostly of xylose with varying lesser amounts of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and rhamnose. The deposition of plant litter is hypothesized to promote a process of succession within the soil community as different plant compounds are degraded sequentially by organisms having different ecological strategies. Hemicellulose and simple sugars are the targets of initial stages of decomposition with degradation of polymeric C lagging. Microbes that respire sugars increase in abundance dramatically during the initial stages of decomposition (Garrett 1951, Alexander 1964), and as much as 75\% of sugar C can be respired or converted into microbial biomass in the first 5 days of decomposition (Engelking et al. 2007). Cellulose degraders take longer to respond (Hu and vanBruggen 1997) with less than 42\% of cellulose metabolized over the first 5 days of incubation (Engelking et al. 2007). Other studies have detected differences in the degradation of labile C and polymeric C substrates \cite{Engelking_2007,Anderson_1973,Stotzky_1961,Alden_2001,Furukawa_1996,Fontaine_2003,Blagodatskaya_2007,Jenkins_2010,Rui_2009,Fierer_2010}. A classic example of plant litter degradative succession is characterized by a series of stages in which sugar fungi dominate in stage one, followed by cellulolytic fungi in stage two, and lignin degrading fungi in the final stage \cite{Gessner_2010}. This demonstrates not only the succession of detritivores but also the sequential degradation of litter constituents starting with consumption of the most labile C sources followed by degradation of more complex and polymeric C sources. These studies suggest that if a complex mixture of labile and polymeric C were added to soil two waves of degradation could be observed; labile C degradation early on and subsequent polymeric C degradation. We propose this temporal cascade from labile C degraders preceeding the polymeric C degraders occurs in natural microbial communities, called herein 'microbial community succession'. It is important to understand these decomposition sequences because as environments are altered it results in measurable and functional changes in soil C \cite{Grandy_2008} which could cumulatively have large impacts at a global scale.   

The aim of this study is to track the path of C added to soil as a complex C mixture to provide insight into these dynamic systems. A previous study has shown that \textsuperscript{13}C labeled plant residues enable tracking of C through microbial pathways \cite{Evershed_2006}. Utilizing this technique with single \textsuperscript{13}C labeled substrates added as a complex C mixture allows us to test how different C substrates cascade through discrete taxa within the soil microbial community. Powerful techniques such as nucleic acid stable isotope probing coupled with next generation sequencing (SIP-NGS) can then be used to parse out and identify these \textsuperscript{13}C labeled portions of the microbial community to reveal the community members that are responsible for the transformation of the labeled C. Using these methods in compilation with microcosm incubations provides a means of looking into microbial community functions while minimizing other environmental factors affecting the fate of C. Ultimately we identify discrete organisms or functional guilds that are responsible for the cycling of specific C substrates.
