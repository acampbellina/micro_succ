<h1 id="significance">Significance</h1>
<p>We have a limited understanding of soil carbon (C) cycling yet soil contains a large fraction of the global C pool. Microorganisms mediate most soil C cycling but have proven difficult to study due to the complexity of soil C biochemistry and the wide range of soil microorganisms participating in C reactions. We demonstrate C use dynamics by soil microbial taxa. Furthermore, we identified microorganisms involved in cellulose decomposition that were previously uncharacterized physiologically – cellulose is the most globally abundant biopolymer. Our results expand knowledge of soil functional guild diversity and activity which reveal soil structure-function relationships. This study is a departure from typical nucleic acid SIP studies that focus on listing the identities of heavy isotope labeled organisms. Our approach enables DNA-SIP to identify <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled microorganisms with greater resolution producing a better sampling of functional guilds. This not only allows us to connect function to genetic identity but also allows us to assess functional guild diversity and uncover ecological strategies. Further, we demonstrate how substrate specificity can be assessed from DNA-SIP data.</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We identified microorganisms participating in xylose and/or cellulose decomposition in soil microcosms using nucleic acid stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled to next generation sequencing. 49 and 63 OTUs assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and cellulose into DNA, respectively. Microorganisms assimilated xylose-C at days 1, 3, and 7. Cellulose-C assimilation peaked at day 14 and was maintained at day 30. Many SIP-identified cellulose degraders are members of cosmopolitan but physiologically uncharacterized soil microbial lineages including <em>Spartobacteria</em>, <em>Chloroflexi</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from Xylose was initially assimilated by <em>Firmicutes</em> followed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actionbacteria</em>. Trophic interactions may have caused this temporal pattern of incorporation. Soil C cycling models, however, often disregard bacterial trophic interactions. Fast growing substrate generalists assimilated xylose-C and slow growing substrate specialists assimilated cellulose-C. Xylose-C assimilators within time points clustered phylogenetically, and cellulose-C assimilators clustered phylogenetically overall. Knowledge of soil C-cycling functional guild diversity, membership and activity will improve the predictive power of terrestrial C flux models.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Excluding plant biomass, there are 2,300 Pg of carbon (C) in soils worldwide which accounts for <span class="math"> ∼ </span>80% of the global terrestrial C pool <span class="citation">(1, 2)</span>. Fungi, archaea, and bacteria degrade plant biomass that reaches soil respiring the majority of plant biomass C producing 10 times more CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> annually than anthropogenic emissions <span class="citation">(3)</span>. Rising atmospheric CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> may stimulate plant growth and in turn increase plant biomass C input to soil <span class="citation">(4)</span>. Current climate change models concur on atmospheric and oceanic, but not terrestrial, global C flux predictions <span class="citation">(5)</span>. Contrasting terrestrial C model predictions reflect how little is known about soil C cycling. We need to establish the roles and diversity of soil microbial community members involved with soil C cycling to reconcile inconsistencies in terrestial C models <span class="citation">(<strong>???</strong>, 6)</span>.</p>
<p>Functional guild membership and diversity establish the connections between soil functions and community structure <span class="citation">(7)</span>. Microorganisms mediate an estimated 80-90% of soil C cycling <span class="citation">(8, 9)</span> but the complexity of soil obfuscates microbial contributions to soil C cycling and the majority of microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory. Stable-isotope probing (SIP), however, links genetic identity and activity without cultivation and has expanded our knowledge of microbial contributions to biogeochemical processes <span class="citation">(10)</span>. Successful applications of SIP have identified organisms which mediate processes performed by functionally specialized microorganisms of limited diversity such as methanogens <span class="citation">(11)</span> but SIP has been less applicable in soil C cycling studies because simultaneous labeling of many different organisms has necessitated prohibitory resolving power. High throughput DNA sequencing technology, however, improves the resolving power of SIP enabling exploration of complex soil C-cycling processes.</p>
<p>This study aimed to observe labile C versus polymeric C assimilation dynamics in the soil microbial community. To soil microcosms we added a mixture of nutrients and C substrates that simulated the composition of plant biomass. All microcosms received the same C substrate mixture where the only difference between treatments was the identity of the isotopically labeled substrate. Specifically, we set up a series of microcosms with three treatments: in one treatment xylose was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-equivalent, in another cellulose was substituted for its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-equivalent, and in the third treatment all substrates in the mixture were unlabeled. We harvested microcosms from each treatment at days 3, 7, 14 and 30 and additionally harvested microcosms receiving <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and unlabeled substrates on day 1. We chose to label xylose and cellulose to contrast labile C and polymeric C decomposition, respectively. Post incubation, we sequenced 16S rRNA genes from SIP density fractions with high throughput DNA sequencing technology. Our experimental design allowed us to observe the soil microbial community members that assimilated xylose-C and cellulose-C over time.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>Our experimental design allowed us to track the flow of xylose and cellulose C through the soil microbial community (Figure S1). 5.3 mg C substrate mixture per gram of soil was added to each microcosm representing 18% of the soil C. The mixture included 0.42 mg xylose-C and 0.88 mg cellulose-C per gram soil. Microcosms were harvested at days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 during a 30 day incubation. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilation peaked immediately and tapered over the 30 day incubation whereas <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose assimilation peaked two weeks after amendment additions (Figure 1, Figure S2). See Supplemental Note XX for sequencing and density fractionation statistics. Microcosm treatments (see Methods) are identified in figures by the following code: “13CXPS” refers to the amendment with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (<span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span><strong>C</strong> <strong>X</strong>ylose <strong>P</strong>lant <strong>S</strong>imulant), “13CCPS” refers to the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose amendment and “12CCPS” refers to the amendment that only contained <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C (i.e. control).</p>
<h2 id="soil-microcosm-microbial-community-changes-with-time">Soil microcosm microbial community changes with time</h2>
<p>Changes in the bulk soil microcosm microbial community structure and membership correlated significantly with time (Figure S3, P-value 0.23, R<span class="math"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span> 0.63, Adonis test <span class="citation">(12)</span>). The identity of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled substrate added to the microcosms did not significantly correlate with bulk soil community structure and membership (P-value 0.35). Additionally, microcosm beta diversity was significantly less than gradient fraction beta diversity (Figure S3, P-value 0.003, “betadisper” function R Vegan package <span class="citation">(13, 14)</span>). Twenty-nine OTUs significantly changed in relative abundance with time (“BH” adjusted P-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span> 0.10, <span class="citation">(15)</span>) and of these 29 OTUs, 14 were found to incorporate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from labeled substrates into biomass (Figure S4). Four taxonomic classes significantly (adjusted P-value <span class="math"> &lt; </span> 0.10) changed in abundance: <em>Bacilli</em> (decreased), <em>Flavobacteria</em> (decreased), <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> (decreased) and <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> (increased) (Figure S5). Abundances grouped by phylum for OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from cellulose increased with time whereas abundances grouped by phylum of OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose decreased over time although <em>Proteobacteria</em> abundance spiked at day 14 (Figure S6).</p>
<h2 id="responders">OTUs that assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA</h2>
<p>Within the first 7 days of incubation 63% of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose was respired and only 6% more was respired from day 7 to 30. At day 30, 30% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose remained in the soil. An average 16% of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose added was respired within the first 7 days, 38% by day 14, and 60% by day 30.</p>
<p>We refer to OTUs that putatively incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into DNA originally from an isotopically labeled substrate as substrate “responders” (see Supplemental Note XX for operational “response” criteria). There were 19, 19, 15, 6, and 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, respectively (Figure S2). The numerically dominant <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder phylum shifted from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and then to <em>Actinobacteria</em> across days 1, 3 and 7 (Figure 2, Figure S7). <em>Proteobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders were found at days 1, 3, 7 but peaked at day 7 (Figure S7).</p>
<p>Only 2 and 5 OTUs responded <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose at days 3 and 7, respectively. At days 14 and 30, 42 and 39 OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose. (Figure S2). <em>Proteobacteria</em>, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, and <em>Chloroflexi</em> had relatively high numbers of responders with strong response across multiple time points (Figure 2). <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were 70% <em>Spartobacteria</em>. <em>Chloroflexi</em> responders were annotated as members of the <em>Herpetosiphonales</em> and <em>Anaerolineae</em> (Figure S8). <em>Cellvibrio</em>, a canonical soil cellulose degrader, was found to respond strongly to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose in the microcosms. See Supplemental Note XX for further counts of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs at greater taxonomic resolution.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-13c-responders">Ecological strategies of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C responders</h2>
<p><span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are generally more abundant members based on relative abundance in bulk DNA SSU rRNA gene content than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders (Figure 3, P-value 0.00028, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). However, <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders included both abundant and rare OTUs (Figure 3). Two <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders were not found in any bulk samples (“OTU.862” and “OTU.1312”, Table [tab:cell]). Of the 10 most abundant responders, 8 are <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders and 6 of these 8 are consistently among the 10 most abundant OTUs in bulk samples.</p>
<p>Cellulose-responder-DNA buoyant density (BD) shifted further along the density gradient than xylose-responder-DNA BD in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation (Figure S9, Figure 3, P-value 1.8610x<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 06</sup></span>, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose-responder-DNA BD shifted on average 0.0163 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094) whereas xylose responder BD shifted on average 0.0097 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> (sd 0.0094). For reference, 100% <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C DNA BD is 0.04 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> greater than the BD of its <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C counterpart. DNA BD increases as its ratio of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C increases. An organism that only assimilates C into DNA from a <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C isotopically labeled source, will have a greater <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C ratio in its DNA than an organism utilizing a mixture of isotopically labeled and unlabeled C sources (see Supplemental Note XX). We predicted the <em>rrn</em> gene copy number for each OTU as described previously <span class="citation">(16)</span>. The estimated <em>rrn</em> gene copy number for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders was inversely related to the time of first response for each OTU (P-value 2.02x10<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 15</sup></span>, Figure S10). OTUs that did not respond at day 1 but did respond at day 3 and/or day 7 had fewer estimated <em>rrn</em> copy number than OTUs that responded at day 1 (Figure S10).</p>
<p>We assessed phylogenetic clustering of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responsive OTUs with the Nearest Taxon Index (NTI), the Net Relatedness Index (NRI) <span class="citation">(17)</span>, and the consenTRAIT metric <span class="citation">(18)</span>. Briefly, positive NRI and NTI with corresponding low P-values indicates deep phylogenetic clustering whereas negative NRI with high P-values indicates taxa are overdispersed compared to the null model <span class="citation">(19)</span>. NRI and P-values for substrate responder groups suggest <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are overdispersed (NRI: -1.33, P: 0.90) while <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders are clustered (NRI: 4.49, P: 0.001). NTI values show that both <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are clustered near the tips of the tree (NTI: 1.43 (P: 0.072), 2.69 (P: 0.001), respectively). The consenTRAIT clade depth for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders was 0.012 and 0.028 16S rRNA sequence dissimilarity, respectively.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<h2 id="microbial-response-to-isotopic-labels">Microbial response to isotopic labels</h2>
<p>DNA-SIP can establish functional roles for thousands of phylotypes in a single experiment without cultivation. We identified 104 soil OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from xylose and/or cellulose into biomass over time. With this information we can build a conceptual model for the soil food web with respect to xylose and cellulose in our microcosms. We propose xylose and cellulose-C added to soil microcosms took the following path through the microbial food web (Figure S11): fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers first assimilated xylose C within 24 hours. Over the next 6 days, biomass from early-responding <em>Firmicutes</em> and the remaining xylose-C and was consumed by <em>Bacteroidetes</em>, <em>Actinobacteria</em>, and <em>Proteobacteria</em> phylotypes. Canonical cellulose degrading bacteria like <em>Cellvibrio</em> and members of cosmopolitan yet functionally uncharacterized soil phylogenetic groups like <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Planctomycetes</em> and <em>Verrucomicrobia</em>, specifically the <em>Spartobacteria</em>, decomposed cellulose. Cellulose C incorporation into microbial biomass peaked at day 14 and extended through day 30.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-strategies-of-soil-microorganisms-participating-in-the-decomposition-of-organic-matter">Ecological strategies of soil microorganisms participating in the decomposition of organic matter</h2>
<p>Models of soil C cycling rely on functional niches defined by soil microbiologists. In these models ecological strategies such as growth rate and substrate specificity are parameters for functional niche behavior <span class="citation">(20)</span>. Functional niches are commonly discovered by observing how community structure changes with changing conditions <span class="citation">Reference 21</span>. In this experiment, DNA-SIP revealed functional niche membership. We also used DNA-SIP data to quantify substrate specificity which is related to the magnitude of DNA BD shift upon <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeling (see Results). Moreover, we assessed growth rate of functional niche members by estimating niche member <em>rrn</em> gene copy number, a genomic feature reliably extrapolated from phylogeny that is indicative of how fast a microorganism grows <span class="citation">(16, 22)</span>. We found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive OTUs are likely slow growing substrate specialists relative to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders (Figure 3, Figure S10). We also found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into biomass at day one grow faster than OTUs that responded later (Figure 3, Figure S10). If OTUs that first responded after day 1 consumed labeled OTUs that responded at day 1, this suggests that predators and/or saprophytes grow slower than microorganisms directly assimilating labile C and has implications for modelling trophic niches. We also note that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders are generally lower abundance members of the bulk community than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs (Figure 3), however, high <em>rrn</em> gene copy number may inflate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose-responder abundance.</p>
<p>NRI values quantify phylogenetic clustering <span class="citation">(17)</span> and have been used to assess clustering of soil OTUs that responded similarly to soil wet up <span class="citation">(19, 23)</span>. To our knowledge, assessing phylogenetic clustering of OTUs found to incorporate heavy isotopes into biomass during SIP incubations has not been attempted. We found that <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C- cellulose and xylose responders are clustered and overdispersed, respectively. This suggests that the ability to degrade cellulose is phylogenetically conserved possibly reflecting the complexity of cellulose degradation biochemistry. The positive relationship between a physiological trait’s phylogenetic depth and its complexity has been noted previously <span class="citation">(24)</span> and the clade depth of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders, 0.028 16S rRNA gene sequence dissimilartiy, is on the same order as that observed for glycoside hydrolases which are diagnostic enzymes for cellulose degradation <span class="citation">(25)</span>. Overdispersion, as we saw for the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs, may be indicative of a readily horizontally transferred trait and/or a trait that is broadly distributed phylogenetically, or, in this case may indicate that the overdispersed group includes more than one trait. It’s not clear which <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive organisms were labeled as a result of primary xylose assimilation (see below), and therefore it’s not clear if <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responsive OTUs in this experiment constitute a single ecologically meaningful group or multiple ecological groups. Temporally defined <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, however, were phylogenetically coherent (Figure S8, Figure S7). For example, most day 1 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are members of the <em>Paenibacillus</em> (see Supplemental Note XX). Notably, <em>Paenibacillus</em> have been previously implicated as labile C decomposers <span class="citation">(26)</span>.</p>
<p>Intuitively we infer C cycling functional guild diversity from the distribution of diagnostic genes across genomes <span class="citation">(25)</span> or from screening culture collections for a particular trait <span class="citation">(18)</span>. For instance, the wide distribution of the glycolysis operon in microbial genomes is interpreted as evidence that many soil microorganisms participate in glucose turnover <span class="citation">(27)</span>. <em>In situ</em> functional guild diversity, however, can vary significantly from diversity assessed by functionally screening isolates and/or genomes. Xylose use in soil, for instance, may be less a function of catabolic pathway distribution across genomes and more a function of lifestyle. Phenomena such as seasonal change <span class="citation">(28)</span>, and rainfall <span class="citation">(23)</span> cause nutrient and resource concentrations in soil to fluctuate. Therefore, fast growth and/or rapid resuscitation upon wet up <span class="citation">(23)</span> allow microorganisms to favorably compete for labile C resources. Life history ecological strategies tied to phylogeny like growth rate <span class="citation">Reference 21</span> may constrain the diversity of labile C assimilators even though the ability to use labile C is phylogenetically dispersed. DNA-SIP is useful for establishing <em>in situ</em> phylogenetic clustering and diversity of functional guilds because DNA-SIP can account for life history strategies by targeting <em>active</em> microorganisms. Additionally, snapshot estimates of community composition commonly inform soil-structure-function-relationship studies <span class="citation">(21)</span> but labile C decomposition might not be linked to snapshot community structure. Alternatively labile C decomposition might be linked specifically to community structure <em>dynamics</em>. That is, fast growing spore formers would not need to maintain high abundance to significantly mediate cycling of pulse delivered resources. This accentuates the importance of DNA-SIP for describing soil ecology as DNA-SIP assesses activity which can be decoupled from snapshot abundance.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-soil-c-cycling-models">Implications for soil C cycling models</h2>
<p>Land management, climate, pollution and disturbance can influence soil community composition <span class="citation">(27)</span> which in turn influences soil biogeochemical process rates (e.g. <span class="citation">(29)</span>). Assessing functional group diversity and establishing identities of functional group members is necessary to predict how biogeochemical process rates will change with community composition <span class="citation">(27, 30)</span>. Aggregate biogeochemical processes that are the sum of many subprocesses involve a broad array of taxa and are assumed to be less influenced by community change than narrow processes that involve a single, specific chemical transformation by a narrow suite of microbial participants <span class="citation">(27, 30)</span>. Within an aggregate process such as C decomposition, subprocesses can be further classified as broad or narrow <span class="citation">(27)</span>. In theory, “broad” and “narrow” functional guilds decompose labile and recalcitrant C, respectively <span class="citation">(27)</span>. However, the diversity of active labile C and recalcitrant C decomposers in soil has not been directly quantified. Notably, we found more OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, 63, than <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, 49. Also, it is possible that many <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predatory bacteria or saprophytes as opposed to primary labile C degraders (see below). Cellulose and xylose decomposer functional guilds were non-overlapping in membership – of 104 <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-responders only 8 responded to both cellulose and xylose – and represented a small fraction of total soil community diversity (Figure 4). While xylose use is undoubtedly more widely distributed among microbial genomes than the ability to degrade cellulose, the number of unique active cellulose decomposer OTUs outnumbered the number of unique active xylose utilizer OTUs.</p>
<p>Trophic interactions and/or functional groups tuned to different resource concentrations caused the activity succession from <em>Firmicutes</em> to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and finally <em>Actinobacteria</em> in response to xylose addition. <em>Actinobacteria</em> (e.g. <em>Agromyces</em>) and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> have been previously implicated as predatory soil bacteria <span class="citation">(31, 32)</span>, and, in our microcosms <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> activity peaked while <em>Firmicutes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder relative abundance plummeted (Figure 2, Figure S7, Figure S6). Considering <em>Agromyces</em> and <em>Bacteroidetes</em> phylotypes are likely soil predators, one parsimonious hypothesis for <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling of <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> with a corresponding decrease in <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em> abundance is that <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> fed on <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled <em>Firmicutes</em>. Besides predation, mother cell lysis, the last step in sporulation, would release C from spore formers potentially to <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em>. If the temporal dynamics of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose incorporation are due to trophic interactions, predatory bacteria or saprophytes consumed many, if not most, fast-growing labile C degraders. Hence, soil C cycling models should include trophic interactions between soil bacteria but rarely do (e.g. <span class="citation">(33)</span>). When soil C models do account for predators/saprophytes, trophic interactions are predicted to significantly influence C:N ratios of SOM relative to litter C:N, and, recycle significant amounts of microbial biomass <span class="citation">(20)</span>.</p>
<p>We propose two scenarios in the context of our results whereby community composition could affect C dynamics and fate. Genomic evidence shows cellulose degradation is a phylogenetically conserved trait <span class="citation">(25)</span>. Our study evaluates the phylogenetic conservation of soil cellulose degradation in active microorganisms via DNA-SIP and our results concur with genomic evidence. A decrease in cellulose degrader abundance would diminish cellulose decomposition process rates as few soil microorganisms can fill the phylogenetically conserved cellulose degradation niche. Dispersed cellulose decomposers could renew ecosystem function, however. For labile C decomposition, the absence of fast growing spore formers would allow other microbes to assimilate labile C provided dispersal does not enable rapid recolonization. Primary labile C degraders in this study grow fast, and form spores and these distinct ecological strategies might indicate distinct C use dynamics and/or resource allocation. New labile C degraders may metabolize and allocate labile C differently thus changing labile C dynamics and fate. Further, labile C degrader substitution could affect biomass C turnover by predatory bacteria or saprophytes that feed on fast growing, spore forming labile C decomposers. On the other hand, spore formation enables dispersal <span class="citation">(34)</span> which would allow fast growing spore formers to continuously occupy the labile C decomposition niche. One proposed mechanism for similar decomposition rates of labile C across soils varying in community composition is that labile C is decomposed by a diverse suite of soil microorganisms <span class="citation">(27)</span>. An alternative hypothesis for consistent labile C process rates across different soils is that labile C degraders disperse readily. Notably, other lineages implicated in rapid labile C turnover include members of the <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="citation">(23)</span> and many soil <em>Actinobacteria</em> form hyphae that facilitate dispersal <span class="citation">(35)</span>. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but our results and previous studies suggest that environmental conditions unfavorable to fast-growing spore-formers and/or quickly resuscitated, hyphal <em>Actinobacteria</em> may impact labile C dynamics and fate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microorganisms sequester atmospheric C and respire SOM influencing climate change on a global scale but we do not know which microorganisms carry out specific soil C transformations. In this experiment microbes from physiologically uncharacterized but ubiquitous soil lineages participated in cellulose decomposition. Cellulose C degraders included members of the <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> (<em>Spartobacteria</em>), <em>Chloroflexi</em>, <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em>. <em>Spartobacteria</em> in particular are globally cosmopolitan soil microorganisms and are often the most abundant <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> order in soil <span class="citation">(36)</span>. Fast-growing <em>Firmicutes</em> spore formers assimilated labile C in our microcosms. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em> phylotypes, previously implicated as predators, may have fed on the fast growing <em>Firmicutes</em>. Our results suggest that, cosmopolitan <em>Spartobacteria</em> may degrade cellulose on a global scale, bacterial tropic interactions can significantly impact soil C cycling, and life history ecological strategies such as fast growth constrain functional guild diversity for labile C decomposition.</p>

<p>Twelve soil cores (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) were collected from six random sampling locations within an organically managed agricultural field in Penn Yan, New York. Soils were pretreated by sieving (2 mm), homogenizing sieved soil, and pre-incubating 10 g of dry soil weight in flasks for 2 weeks. Soils were amended with a 5.3 mg g soil<sup>-1</sup> carbon mixture; representative of natural concentrations <span class="citation">Reference 37</span>. Mixture contained 38% cellulose, 23% lignin, 20% xylose, 3% arabinose, 1% galactose, 1% glucose, and 0.5% mannose by mass, with the remaining 13.5% mass composed of an amino acid (in-house made replica of Teknova C0705) and basal salt mixture (Murashige and Skoog, Sigma Aldrich M5524). Three parallel treatments were performed; (1) unlabeled control,(2)<sup>13</sup>C-cellulose, (3)<sup>13</sup>C-xylose (98 atom% <sup>13</sup>C, Sigma Aldrich). Each treatment had 2 replicates per time point (n = 4) except day 30 which had 4 replicates; total microcosms per treatment n = 12, except <sup>13</sup>C-cellulose which was not sampled at day 1, n = 10. Other details relating to substrate addition can be found in SI. Microcosms were sampled destructively (stored at -80<span class="math"><em></em><sup> ∘ </sup></span>C until nucleic acid processing) at days 1 (control and xylose only), 3, 7, 14, and 30.</p>
<p>Nucleic acids were extracted using a modified Griffiths procotol <span class="citation">Reference 38</span>. To prepare nucleic acid extracts for isopycnic centrifugation as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 39</span>, DNA was size selected (&gt;4kb) using 1% low melt agarose gel and <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>-agarase I enzyme extraction per manufacturers protocol (New England Biolab, M0392S). For each time point in the series isopycnic gradients were setup using a modified protocol <span class="citation">Reference 40</span> for a total of five <sup>12</sup>C-control, five <sup>13</sup>C-xylose, and four <sup>13</sup>C-cellulose microcosms. A density gradient (average density 1.69 g mL<sup>-1</sup>) solution of 1.762 g cesium chloride (CsCl) ml<sup>-1</sup> in gradient buffer solution (pH 8.0 15 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM EDTA, 15 mM KCl) was used to separate <sup>13</sup>C-enriched and <sup>12</sup>C-nonenriched DNA. Each gradient was loaded with approximately 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>g of DNA and ultracentrifuged for 66 h at 55,000 rpm and room temperature (RT). Fractions of <span class="math"> ∼ </span>100 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L were collected from below by displacing the DNA-CsCl-gradient buffer solution in the centrifugation tube with water using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3.3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L s<sup>-1</sup> <span class="citation">Reference 41</span> into Acroprep<sup>TM</sup> 96 filter plate (Pall Life Sciences 5035). The refractive index of each fraction was measured using a Reichart AR200 digital refractometer modified as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 39</span> to measure a volume of 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L. Then buoyant density was calculated from the refractive index as previously described <span class="citation">Reference 39</span> (see also SI). The collected DNA fractions were purified by repetitive washing of Acroprep filter wells with TE. Finally, 50 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L TE was added to each fraction then resuspended DNA was pipetted off the filter into a new microfuge tube.</p>
<p>For every gradient, 20 fractions were chosen for sequencing between the density range 1.67-1.75 g mL<sup>-1</sup>. Barcoded 454 primers were designed using 454-specific adapter B, 10 bp barcodes <span class="citation">Reference 42</span>, a 2 bp linker (5’-CA-3’), and 806R primer for reverse primer (BA806R); and 454-specific adapter A, a 2 bp linker (5’-TC-3’), and 515F primer for forward primer (BA515F). Each fraction was PCR amplified using 0.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 U <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>l<sup>-1</sup> AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; N8080243), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10X Buffer II (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 25 mM MgCl<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, 4 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 mM dNTP, 1.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> BSA, 0.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA515F, 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA806R, 3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L H<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>O, 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 1:30 DNA template) in triplicate. Samples were normalized either using Pico green quantification and manual calculation or by SequalPrep<sup>TM</sup> normalization plates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; A10510), then pooled in equimolar concentrations. Pooled DNA was gel extracted from a 1% agarose gel using Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI; A9281) per manufacturer’s protocol. Amplicons were sequenced on Roche 454 FLX system using titanium chemistry at Selah Genomics (formerly EnGenCore, Columbia, SC)</p>
