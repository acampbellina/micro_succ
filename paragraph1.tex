\section{Introduction}
\dropcap{W}e have only a rudimentary understanding of carbon flow through soil microbial communities. This deficiency is driven by the staggering complexity of soil microbial food webs and the opacity of these biological systems to current methods for describing microbial metabolism in the environment. Relating community composition to overall soil processes, such as nitrification and denitrification, which are mediated by defined functional groups has been a useful approach. However, carbon-cycling processes have proven more recalcitrant to study due to the wide range of organisms participating in these reactions and our inability to discern diagnostic functional genetic markers.
