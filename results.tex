\section{Results}
We ran a temporal series of parallel microcosms and measured the changes in the microbial community as result of the addition of a complex carbon mixture and 454 pyrosequenced the bulk microbial community and fractions from SIP gradient fractionation (Fig. S1). Analysis of the sequenced bulk community DNA demonstrates (insert taxa here) as the most dominant taxa at days 1, 3, and 7 followed by a transistion to a (insert taxa here) dominated community at days 14 and 30. Most abundant OTUs at earlier time points were most closely related to members of Bacteriodetes, Actinomycetes, and Proteobacteria. Abundant OTUs of later time points were most closely related to members of Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. 

Twenty fractions from a SIP gradient fractionation for each treatment at each time point were sequenced. Using NMDS analysis from weighted unifrac distances the relationship between all the fractions from all treatments and time points are projected into the ordination space (Fig 1). Each point on the NMDS represents the microbial community from a single fraction where the size of the point is representative of the density of that fraction (the smaller the point, the less dense) and the colors represent the treatments (Fig1A) or days (Fig1B). NMDS1 explains the greatest amount of variation in the data (put in the amount of variation explained here\%) based on density. NMDS2 explains the second greatest amount of variation in the data (put in percent\%) which correlates to fractions of greater density (1.73-1.74...figure out exact densities) that contain 13C-substrate responders separating away from the control at days 1,3, and 7 for the xylose treatment and days 14 and 30 for the cellulose treatment. 13C-labeled organisms are expected be to found in the denser fractions (large points, Fig x). Using biplots/Edge PCA, potentially 13C-responsive OTUs were resolved.  Targeting potentially responsive OTUs, their relative abundance in all fractions can be traced for an experimental treatment and compared to its relative abundance in the control fractions from the same time point (Fig Y).
