\subsection{Putative spore-formers in the Firmicutes assimilate $^{13}$C from
xylose within first day after soil amendment followed by Bacteroidetes and then
Actinobacteria OTUs} 
Within the first 7 days of incubation 63\% on average of $^{13}$C-xylose was
respired and only an additional 6\% more was respired from day 7 to 30. At
the end of the 30 day incubation 30\% of the $^{13}$C from added xylose
remained in the soils. The $^{13}$C remaining in the soil from $^{13}$C-xylose
addition was likely stabilized by assimilation into microbial biomass
and/or microbial conversion into other forms of organic matter. It is also
possible that some $^{13}$C-xylose remains unavailable to microbes due to
abiotic interactions in soil \citep{Kalbitz_2000}.
