\subsection{Variation in bulk soil DNA microbial community structure is
significantly less than variation in gradient fractions} 
Responder abundances summed at phylum level generally 
increased for $^{13}$C-cellulose (Figure~XX) whereas $^{13}$C-xylose responder abundances 
summed at the phylum level decreased over time for \textit{Firmicutes}, \textit{Bacteroidetes},
\textit{Actinobacteria} and \textit{Proteobacteria} although 
\textit{Proteobacteria} spiked at day 14 (Figure~\ref{fig:babund}). Bulk abundance trends are
roughly consistent with $^{13}$C assimilation activity.
