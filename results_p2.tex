We sequenced SSU rRNA gene smplicons from a total of 277 CsCl gradient fractions from 14 
CsCl gradients and 
12 bulk microcosm DNA samples. The SSU rRNA gene data set contained 1,376,008 total sequences.
The average number of sequences per sample was 3,816 (sd 3,629) and 265 samples had over 1,000
sequences. We sequenced SSU rRNA gene amplicons from an average of 19.8 fractions per CsCl
gradient (sd 0.57). The average density between fractions was  0.0040 g mL$^{-1}$ 
The sequencing effort recoverd a total of 5,940 OTUs. 2,943 of the total
5,940 OTUs were observed in bulk samples. We observed 33 unique phylum and 340 unique genus
annotations.
