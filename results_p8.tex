\textit{Chloroflexi} are traditionally known for metabolically dynamic
lifestyles ranging from anoxygenic phototrophy to organohalide respiration
\citep{Hug_2013}. Recent studies have focused on \textit{Chloroflexi} roles in
C cycling \citep{Hug_2013, Goldfarb_2011,Cole_2013} and several
\textit{Chloroflexi} utilize cellulose \citep{Goldfarb_2011, Cole_2013,
Hug_2013}. Four closely related OTUs in an undescribed \textit{Chloroflexi}
lineage (closest matching cultured isolate for all four OTUs:
\textit{Herpetosiphon geysericola}, 89\% sequence identity,
Table~\ref{tab:cell}) responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose (Figure~\ref{fig:trees}).
One additional OTU also from a poorly characterized \textit{Chloroflexi}
lineage (closest cultured isolate match a proteobacterium at 78\% sequence
identity) responded to $^{13}$C-cellulose (Figure~\ref{fig:trees}).
