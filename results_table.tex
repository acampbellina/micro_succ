\section{Discussion}

While we are currently able to resolve highly responsive OTUs which has provided greater taxonomic resolution than previous techniques (cloning, TRFLP), the next step is to find better ways to resolve taxa that are partially responsive resulting in a less dramatic effect from the microbial community than highly responsive taxa.  

PCoA demonstrates microbial succession and based on xylose and cellulose falling out separately, it indicates different microbial community members are responsible for C degradation.  Using X ordination we can tease out members that cause the greatest shift in treatment versus control.  We then generate C utilization charts to demonstration discrete OTUs in control versus treatment.  Bulk community shifts over time.
