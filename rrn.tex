\subsection{Changes in estimated rRNA operon copy number per genome in
substrate responder groups defined temporally and by substrate} $^{13}$C-xylose
responder rRNA operon genome copy number is inversely related to time of first
response (p-value 2.02e$^{-15}$, Figure~\ref{fig:copy}). OTUs that first
respond at later time points have fewer estimated rRNA operons per genome than
OTUs that first respond earlier (Figure~\ref{fig:copy}). rRNA operon copy
number estimation is a recent advance in microbiome science \citep{Kembel_2012}
while the relationship of rRNA operon copy number per genome with ecological
strategy is well established \citep{Klappenbach_2000}.  Microorganisms with a
high number of rRNA operons per genome tend to be fast growers specialized to
take advantage of boom-bust environments whereas microorganisms with low rRNA
operon copy numbers per genome favor slower growth under lower and more
consistent nutrient input \citep{Klappenbach_2000}. At the beginning of our
incubation, OTUs with estimated high rRNA operon copy numbers per genome or
``fast-growers'' assimilate xylose into biomass and with time slower growers
(lower rRNA operon number per genome) begin to respond to the xylose addition.
Further, $^{13}$C-xylose responders have more estimated rRNA operon copy
numbers per genome than $^{13}$C-cellulose responders (p-value 1.878e$^{-09}$)
suggesting xylose respiring microbes are generally faster growers than
cellulose degraders.
