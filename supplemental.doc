<h2 id="soil-collection-and-preparation">Soil Collection and Preparation</h2>
<p>We collected soils from an organic farm in Penn Yan, New York. Soils are Honoeye/Lima, a silty clay loam on calcareous bedrock. To get a field average, cores (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) were collected in duplicate from six different sampling locations around the field using a slide hammer bulk density sampler (coordinates: (1) N 42° 40.288’ W 77° 02.438’, (2) N 42° 40.296’ W 77° 02.438’, (3) N 42° 40.309’ W 77° 02.445’, (4) N 42° 40.333’ W 77° 02.425’, (5) N 42° 40.340’ W 77° 02.420’, (6) N 42° 40.353’ W 77° 02.417’) on November 21, 2011. Soil cores were sieved through (2mm), homogenized by mixing, and stored at 4°C until preincubation (within 1-2 week of collection). Carbon and nitrogen content were previously measured for these soils <span class="citation">(1)</span>. Reported soil C values for the organic field were 12.15 (<span class="math"> ± </span> s.d. 0.78) mg C g<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> dry soil and 1.16 (<span class="math"> ± </span> s.d. 0.13) mg N g<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> dry soil.</p>
<h2 id="cellulose-production">Cellulose production</h2>
<p>Bacterial cellulose was produced by <em>Gluconoacetobacter xylinus</em> grown in Heo and Son <span class="citation">(2)</span> liquid minimal media made with 0.1% glucose (one batch with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C and another with <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-glucose). All cellulose (<span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C) was grown in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL Heo and Son minimal media that were inoculated with three colonies of <em>Gluconoacetobacter xylinus</em> from on Heo and Son 0.1% glucose agar plates (using <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C-glucose) at 30°C without inositol. Flasks were incubated statically in the dark at 30°C for 2-3 weeks until as thick cellulose pellicule formed. Cellulose pellicules were collected and washed with two parts 1% alconox and autoclaved. Cellulose pellicules were purified by repeated (10x) overnight dialysis in 1 L deionized water. Harvested pellicules were dried overnight (60°C) and then cut into pieces and ground using ball grinder until the desired size range (53<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>m - 250<span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>m) was achieved (size was checked by dry sieving). Size range was based on particulate organic matter to emulate how microbes may experience cellulose in the environment <span class="citation">(3)</span> and for even distribution in microcosms.</p>
<p>Post processing, purity of ground cellulose was checked with <em>E.coli</em> cultures, Benedict’s reducing sugars assay, Bradford assay, and isotopic analysis. <em>E.coli</em> is not able to use cellulose as a C source but is capable of growth on a variety of nutrients available in the Heo and Son medium. Biological assays consisted of E. coli inoculated into minimal M9 media which lacked a carbon source and was supplemented with either: (1) 0.01% glucose, (2) 2.5 mg purified, ground cellulose, (3) 25 mg purified, ground cellulose, (4) 25 mg purified, ground cellulose and 0.01% glucose. Growth in media was checked by spectrometer (OD450). No measureable growth was observed with either 2 mg or 25 mg cellulose, indicating absence of contaminating nutrients. In addition, the presence of 25 mg cellulose did not inhibit the growth of <em>E.coli</em> cultures provided with glucose relative to control, indicating the absence of compounds that may inhibit microbial growth in the purified cellulose.</p>
<p>Purified cellulose was also assayed for residual proteins and sugars using Bradford and Benedict’s assays, respectively. Bradford assay was performed as in <span class="citation">(4)</span> with a standard curve ranging from 0 - 2000 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>g ml <span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> BSA. Ground, purified cellulose contained 6.92 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>g protein mg cellulose<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup>(<em>i.e.</em></span> 99.31% purity). Reducing sugars were not detected in cellulose using Benedict’s reducing sugar assay <span class="citation">(5)</span> tested at 10 mg cellulose ml<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>. Finally, <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose had an average 96% <span class="math"> ± </span> 5 (s.d.) degree of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeling as determined by isotopic analysis (UCDavis Stable Isotope Facility).</p>
<h2 id="soil-microcosms">Soil microcosms</h2>
<p>A subset of soil was dried at 105°C overnight to determine soil moisture content gravimetrically. Microcosms (35 total) were started by adding the 10 g approximate dry soil weight of the sieved soil to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask capped with a butyl rubber stopper to prevent drying. Microcosms were preincubated at 25°C for 2 weeks until the soil respiration rate (determined by GCMS measurement of head space CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>) had stabilized. Sieving causes a transient increase in soil respiration rate presumably due to the liberation of fresh labile soil organic matter <span class="citation">(6)</span>. Pre-incubation ensures that this labile organic matter is consumed and/or stabilized prior to the beginning of the experiment. Respiration rate (CO<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>) began to plateau around 10 days, with no change in rate after that time. Stoppers were removed for 10 min every 3 days to exchange the headspace with air.</p>
<p>Three parallel treatments were performed with identical amendments of carbon which varied only with respect to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labelling as follows: (1) unlabeled control, (2) <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (synthesis and purity described above), (3) <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose (98 atom% <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C, Sigma Aldrich 666378). Each treatment had 2 replicates per time point (n = 4) except day 30 which had 4 replicates; total microcosms per treatment n = 12, except <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose which was not sampled at day 1 (n = 10). Each microcosm received an evenly distributed dry addition of insoluble substrates (2 mg cellulose and 1.2 mg lignin g dry soil<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>) and a liquid addition (1.2 mL) of a complex substrate mixture. The complete amendment (dry and liquid additions) was added to each microcosm at 5.3 mg g dry soil<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>; representative of natural concentrations <span class="citation">(7)</span>. The complex mixture was designed based on switch grass biomass composition <span class="citation">(8, 9)</span> to include (by mass) 38% cellulose, 23% lignin, 20% xylose, 3% arabinose, 1% galactose, 1% glucose, and 0.5% mannose, with the remaining 13.5% mass composed of amino acids (in-house made replica of teknova Cat#C0705) and basal salt mixture (Murashige and Skoog, Sigma M5524) for a final C:N of 10. The volume of the liquid addition was chosen to achieve 50% water holding capacity of the soil. Water holding capacity of 50% was chosen to achieve <span class="math"> ∼ </span>70% water filled pore space in these soils based on soil texture, which is the optimal water content for respiration <span class="citation">(10, 10)</span>.</p>
<p>Replicate microcosms were harvested (stored at -80<span class="math"><em></em><sup> ∘ </sup></span>C until nucleic acid processing) at days 1 (control and xylose only), 3, 7, 14, and 30. A subset of microcosm soil for each treatment and time point were isotopically analyzed at Cornell University Stable Isotope Laboratory to determine amount of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C that remained at each time point.</p>
<h2 id="nucleic-acid-extraction">Nucleic acid extraction</h2>
<p>Nucleic acids were extracted from 0.25 g soil using a modified Griffiths protocol <span class="citation">(11)</span>. Cell were lysed by bead beating for 1 min at 5.5 ms<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> in 2mL lysis tubes containing 0.5 g of 0.1 mm diameter silica/zirconia beads (treated at 300°C for 4 hours to remove RNases), 0.5 mL extraction buffer (240 mM Phosphate buffer 0.5% N-lauryl sarcosine), and 0.5 mL phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) for 1 min at 5.5 ms<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>. After lysis, 85 uL 5 M NaCl and 60 uL 10% hexadecyltriammonium bromide (CTAB)/0.7 M NaCl were added to lysis tube, vortexed, chilled for 1 min on ice, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. The aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube and reserved on ice. To increase DNA recovery, the pellet was back extracted with 85 uL 5 M NaCl and 0.5 mL extraction buffer. The aqueous extract was washed with 0.5 mL chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 2 volumes polyethylene glycol solution (30% PEG 8000, 1.6 M NaCl) on ice for 2 hrs, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g, 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded and pellets were washed with 1 mL ice cold 70% EtOH. Pellets were air dried, resuspended in 50 uL TE and stored at -20°C. To prepare nucleic acid extracts for isopycnic centrifugation as previously described <span class="citation">(12)</span>, DNA was size selected (<span class="math"> &gt; </span> 4kb) using 1% low melt agarose gel and <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>-agarase I enzyme extraction per manufacturers protocol (New England Biolab, M0392S). Final resuspension of DNA pellet was in 50 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L TE.</p>
<h2 id="isopycnic-centrifugation-and-fractionation">Isopycnic centrifugation and fractionation</h2>
<p>For each time point in the series isopycnic gradients were setup using a modified protocol <span class="citation">(13)</span> for a total of five <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C-control, five <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose, and four <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose microcosms. A density gradient (average density 1.69 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>) solution of 1.762 g cesium chloride (CsCl) ml<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> in gradient buffer solution (pH 8.0 15 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM EDTA, 15 mM KCl) was used to separate <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-enriched and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>12</sup></span>C-non-enriched DNA. Each gradient was loaded with approximately 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>g of DNA and centrifuged on a Beckman Coulter Optima<span class="math"><em></em><sup><em>T</em><em>M</em></sup></span> MAX-E ultracentrifuge using a TLA-110 fixed-angle rotor for 66 h at 55,000 rpm and room temperature (RT). Fractions of <span class="math"> ∼ </span>100 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L were collected from below by displacing the DNA-CsCl-gradient buffer solution in the centrifugation tube with water using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3.3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L s<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> <span class="citation">(14)</span> into Acroprep<span class="math"><em></em><sup><em>T</em><em>M</em></sup></span> 96 filter plate (part no. 5035, Pall Life Sciences). The refractive index of each fraction was measured using a Reichart AR200 digital refractometer modified as previously described to measure a volume of 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L <span class="citation">(12)</span>. Buoyant density was calculated from the refractive index as previously described <span class="citation">(12)</span> using the equation <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span>=<em>a</em><span class="math"><em>η</em></span>-<em>b</em>, where <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span> is the density of the CsCl (g ml<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span>), <span class="math"><em>η</em></span> is the measured refractive index, and <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are coefficient values of 10.9276 and 13.593, respectively, for CsCl at 20°C <span class="citation">(15)</span>. The collected DNA fractions were purified by repetitive washing of Acroprep filter wells with TE. Finally, 50 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L TE was added to each fraction then resuspended DNA was pipetted off the filter into a new microfuge tube.</p>
<h2 id="dna-sequencing">DNA Sequencing</h2>
<p>For every gradient, 20 fractions between the density range 1.67-1.75 g mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> were chosen for sequencing. A total of 14 gradients (280 fractions) and their corresponding bulk DNA extraction (after <span class="math"><em>β</em></span>-agarase size selection) were amplified for sequencing. Barcoded 454 primers were designed using 454-specific adapter B, 10 bp barcodes <span class="citation">(16)</span>, a 2 bp linker (5’-CA-3’), and 806R primer for reverse primer (BA806R); and 454-specific adapter A, a 2 bp linker (5’-TC-3’), and 515F primer for forward primer (BA515F). Each fraction was PCR amplified using 0.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5U <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>l<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; N8080243), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10X Buffer II (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 25 mM MgCl<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, 4 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 mM dNTP, 1.25 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 mg mL<span class="math"><em></em><sup> − 1</sup></span> BSA, 0.5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA515F, 1 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 5 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>M BA806R, 3 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L H<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>O, 10 <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span>L 1:30 DNA template) in triplicate and checked by 1% agarose gel. Samples were normalized either using Pico green quantification and manual calculation or by SequalPrep<span class="math"><em></em><sup><em>T</em><em>M</em></sup></span> normalization plates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; A10510), then pooled in equimolar concentrations. Pooled DNA was gel extracted from a 1% agarose gel using Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI; A9281) per manufacturer’s protocol. Amplicons were sequenced on Roche 454 FLX system using titanium chemistry at Selah Genomics (formerly EnGenCore, Columbia, SC)</p>
<h2 id="post-sequencing-analysis">Post-Sequencing Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sequence-quality-control">Sequence quality control</h3>
<p>Sequences were initially screened by maximum expected errors at a specific read length threshold <span class="citation">(17)</span> which has been shown to be as effective as denoising with respect to removing pyrosequencing errors. Specifically, reads were first truncated to 250 nucleotides (nt) (all reads shorter than 250 nt were discarded) and any read that exceeded a maximum expected error threshold of 0.5 was removed. After truncation and max expected error trimming, 87% of original reads remained. The forward primer and barcode was then removed from the high quality, truncated reads. Remaining reads were taxonomically annotated using the “UClust” taxonomic annotation framework in the QIIME software package <span class="citation">(18, 19)</span> with cluster seeds from Silva SSU rRNA database <span class="citation">(20)</span> 97% sequence identity OTUs as reference (release 111Ref). Reads annotated as “Chloroplast”, “Eukaryota”, “Archaea”, “Unassigned” or “mitochondria” were culled from the dataset. Finally, reads were aligned to the Silva reference alignment provided by the Mothur software package <span class="citation">(21)</span> using the Mothur NAST aligner <span class="citation">(22)</span>. All reads that did not align to the expected amplicon region of the SSU rRNA gene were discarded. Quality control parameters removed 344,472 of 1,720,480 raw reads.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-clustering">Sequence clustering</h3>
<p>Sequences were distributed into OTUs using the UParse methodology <span class="citation">(17)</span>. Specifically, OTU centroids (i.e. seeds) were identified using USearch on non-redundant reads sorted by count. The sequence identity threshold for establishing a new OTU centroid was 97%. With USearch/UParse, potential chimeras are identified during OTU centroid selection and are not allowed to become cluster centroids effectively removing chimeras from the read pool. All quality controlled reads were then mapped to cluster centroids at an identity threshold of 97% again using USearch. 97% of quality controlled reads could be mapped to centroids. Unmapped reads do not count towards sample counts and are removed from downstream analyses. The USearch software version for cluster generation was 7.0.1090.</p>
<h3 id="phylogenetic-analysis">Phylogenetic analysis</h3>
<p>Alignment of OTU centroid SSU rRNA genes was done with SSU-Align which is based on Infernal <span class="citation">(23, 24)</span>. Columns in the alignment that were not included in the SSU-Align covariance models or were aligned with poor confidence (less than 95% of characters in a position had posterior probability alignment scores of at least 95%) were masked for phylogenetic reconstruction. Additionally, the alignment was trimmed to coordinates such that all sequences in the alignment began and ended at the same positions. FastTree <span class="citation">(25)</span> was used to reconstruct the phylogeny with default parameters.</p>
<h3 id="fc">Identifying OTUs that incorporated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C into their DNA</h3>
<p>DNA-SIP is a culture-independent approach that defines identity-function connections in microbial communities <span class="citation">(13, 26, 27)</span>. Microbes are identified on the basis of isotope assimilation into DNA. As the buoyant density (BD) of a macromolecule is dependent on many factors in addition to stable isotope incorporation (e.g. GC-content in nucleic acids <span class="citation">(28)</span>), labeled nucleic acids from one microbial population may have the same BD as unlabeled nucleic acids from another. Therefore, it is imperative to compare results of isotopic labelling to results obtained with unlabeled controls where everything mimics experimental conditions except that substrates are unlabeled. By contrasting heavy gradient fractions from isotopically labeled samples relative to corresponding fractions from controls, the identities of microbes with labeled nucleic acids can be determined</p>
<p>We used an RNA-Seq differential expression statistical framework <span class="citation">(29)</span> to find OTUs enriched in heavy fractions of labeled gradients relative to corresponding density fractions in control gradients (for review of RNA-Seq differential expression statistics applied to microbiome OTU count data see <span class="citation">(30)</span>). We use the term “differential abundance” (coined by <span class="citation">(30)</span>) to denote OTUs that have different abundance across sample classes (in this case the only sample class is labeled or control). CsCl gradient fractions were categorized as “heavy” or “light”. The heavy category denotes fractions with density values above 1.7125 and below 1.755 g/mL. Since we are only interested in enriched OTUs (labeled versus control), we used a one-sided test to assess the significance of differential abundance (the null hypothesis was that the differential abundance (labeled:control) for an OTU is less than a selected threshold). P-values were corrected with the Benjamini and Hochberg method <span class="citation">(31)</span>.</p>
<p>We selected a log<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> fold change null threshold of 0.75 (or a labeled:control differential abundance of 1.68).</p>
<p>DESeq2 was used to calculate moderated log<span class="math"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> fold change of labeled:control abundance and corresponding standard errors for the one-sided Wald test. Fold change moderation allows for reliable ranking of fold change for each OTU such that high variance and likely statistically insignificant fold changes are appropriately shrunk and subsequently ranked lower than they would be as raw fold change. OTU DNA that enriches significantly in heavy fractions from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeled samples relative to corresponding controls has increased significantly in buoyant density in response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C treatment.</p>
<h3 id="ord">Community and Sequence Analysis</h3>
<p>Principal coordinate ordinations depict the relationships between samples. Weighted Unifrac <span class="citation">(32)</span> distances were used as the sample distance metric for ordination. The Phyloseq <span class="citation">(33)</span> wrapper for Vegan <span class="citation">(34)</span> (both R packages) was used to compute sample values along principal coordinate axes. GGplot2 <span class="citation">(35)</span> was used to display sample points along the first and second principal axes. Adonis tests <span class="citation">(36)</span> were done with 1000 permutations.</p>
<p>Nucleic-acid SIP coupled to microbiome fingerprinting techniques progressed from simple proof-of-concept experiments with pure cultures <span class="citation">(37)</span> to DGGE, ARISA and/or tRFLP-enabled studies of microcosm microbial assemblages <span class="citation">(38)</span>. Recently large experiments employed multiple labeled substrates and high-throughput amplicon and/or shotgun DNA sequencing <span class="citation">(39)</span> revealing the relative contributions of sampling location and DNA-SIP gradient density on phylogenetic profile variance from DNA-SIP experiments (CITE Conrad and Neufeld). Although density gradient position can account for approximately XX% of phylogenetic profile variance, soil type appears to represent greater variance than can be established across density gradients from soil DNA. Association of phylogenetic types with “heavy” DNA-SIP density gradient fractions in labeled gradients and not “heavy” fractions in unlabeled control gradients suggests label incorporation into biomass for the associated phylogenetic type. Our study shows that DNA-SIP can also characterize C use in three additional dimensions 1) temporally, isotopic labels can demonstrate C substrate use dynamics on the scale of days both between substrates and for a single substrate, 2) profiling DNA-SIP density gradients along the full gradient length can demonstrate patterns in substrate use specificity, and 3) <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation can be established at high resolution taxonomic groups such as 97% sequence identity OTUs.</p>

<h2 id="BD">Buoyant density shift estimates</h2>
<p>Upon labeling, DNA from an organism that incorporates exclusively <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C will increase in BD more than DNA from an organism that does not exclusively utilize isotopically labeled C. Therefore the magnitude DNA BD shifts indicate substrate specificity given our experimental design as only one substrate was labeled in each amendment. We measured density shift as the change in an OTU’s density profile center of mass between corresponding control and labeled gradients. BD shifts, however, should not be evaluated on an individual OTU basis as a small number of density shifts are observed for each OTU and the variance of the density shift metric at the level of individual OTUs is unknown. It is therefore more informative to compare density shifts among substrate responder groups. Further, density shifts are based on relative abundance profiles and would be distorted in comparison to density shifts based on absolute abundance profiles and should be interpreted with this transformation in mind. It should also be noted that there was overlap in observed density shifts between <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose and <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder groups, suggesting that although cellulose degraders are generally more substrate specific than xylose utilizers, each responder group exhibits a range of substrate specificities (Figure XX).</p>

The remaining <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> responders did not share high sequence identity with any isolates (maximum sequence identity with any isolate 93%). Only two of the ten putative cellulose degrading <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> identified in this experiment share at least 95% sequence identity with an isolate (“OTU.83” and “OTU.627”, Table [tab:cell]). Seven of ten <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responding verrucomicrobial OTUs were classified as <em>Spartobacteria</em> which are a numerically dominant family of <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> in SSU rRNA gene surveys of 181 globally distributed soil samples <span class="citation">(42)</span>. Given their ubiquity and abundance in soil as well as their demonstrated incorporation of <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C from <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose, <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> lineages, particularly <em>Spartobacteria</em>, may be important contributors to cellulose decomposition on a global scale.</p>
<h3 id="cell:chloro">Chloroflexi</h3>
<p><em>Chloroflexi</em> are known for metabolically dynamic lifestyles ranging from anoxygenic phototrophy to organohalide respiration <span class="citation">(51)</span>. Recent studies have focused on <em>Chloroflexi</em> roles in C cycling <span class="citation">(51–53)</span> and several <em>Chloroflexi</em> utilize cellulose <span class="citation">(51–53)</span>. Cellulose degrading soil <em>Chloroflexi</em> have previously been identified in DNA-SIP studies <span class="citation">(54)</span> and <em>Chloroflexi</em> are among the six most abundant soil phyla commonly recovered soil microbial diversity surveys <span class="citation">(55)</span>. The cellulose degrading <em>Chloroflexi</em> in this study are only distantly related to isolates [tab:cell]. Chloroflexi are typically not as as abundant as <em>Verrucomicrobia</em> but are roughly as abundant as <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and <em>Planctomycetes</em> <span class="citation">(55)</span>. Four of five <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responsive <em>Chloroflexi</em> identified in this study are annotated as belonging to the <em>Herpetosiphon</em> although they share less than 95% sequence identity with their closest cultured relative in the <em>Herpetosiphon</em> genus (<em>H. geysericola</em>). <em>H. geysericola</em> is a predatory bacterium shown to prey upon <em>Aerobacter</em> in culture and can also digest cellulose <span class="citation">(56)</span>. One non-<em>Herpetosiphon</em> <em>Chloroflexi</em> OTU also from a poorly characterized <em>Chloroflexi</em> lineage (closest cultured isolate matched a proteobacterium at 78% sequence identity) responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose (Figure S8).In our study, “Herpetosiphon” <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders did not show a delayed response to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose as compared to other responders but nonetheless could have become labeled by feeding on primary <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose degraders. The prey specificity of predatory bacteria is not well established especially <em>in situ</em>. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-labeling would be positively correlated with prey specificity. If the predator specifically preyed upon one population then it could take on the same labeling percent as that population given enough generations. Preying on multiple types would produce a mixed and dilute labeling signature if some of the prey were not isotopically labeled.</p>
<h3 id="cell:others">Others</h3>
<p>Other notable <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders include a <em>Bacteroidetes</em> OTU that shares high sequence identity (99%) to <em>Sporocytophaga myxococcoides</em> a known cellulose degrader <span class="citation">(57)</span>, and three <em>Actinobacteria</em> OTUs that share high sequence identity (100%) with isolates. One of the three <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders is in the <em>Streptomyces</em>, a genus known to possess cellulose degraders, while the other two share high sequence identity to cultured isolates <em>Allokutzneriz albata</em> <span class="citation">(58, 59)</span> and <em>Lentzea waywayandensis</em> <span class="citation">(60, 61)</span>; neither isolate decomposes cellulose in culture. Nine <em>Planctomycetes</em> OTUs responded to <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose but none are within described genera (closest cultured isolate match 91% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]) (Figure S8). One <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responder is annotated as “cyanobacteria”. The cyanobacteria phylum annotation is misleading as the OTU is not closely related to any oxygenic phototrophs (closest cultured isolate match <em>Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus</em>, 95% sequence identity, Table [tab:cell]). A sister clade to the oxygenic phototrophs classically annotated as “cyanobacteria” in SSU rRNA gene reference databases, but does not possess any known phototrophs, has recently been proposed to constitute its own phylum, “Melainabacteria” <span class="citation">(62)</span>; although, the phylogenetic position of “Melainabacteria” is debated <span class="citation">(63)</span>. The catalog of metabolic capabilities associated with cyanobacteria (or candidate phyla previously annotated as cyanobacteria) are quickly expanding <span class="citation">(62, 63)</span>. Our findings provide evidence for cellulose degradation within a lineage closely related to but apart from oxygenic phototrophs. Notably, polysaccharide degradation is suggested by an analysis of a “Melainabacteria” genome <span class="citation">(62)</span>. Although we highlight <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders that share high sequence identity with described genera, most <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-cellulose responders uncovered in this experiment are not closely related to cultured isolates (Table [tab:cell]). <em>Acidobacteria</em> did not pass or operational criteria for assessing <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C incorporation from cellulose into DNA in our microcosms. <em>Acidobacteria</em> have been found to degrade cellulose in culture CITE and are a numerically significant soil phylum CITE. <em>Acidobacteria</em> have been shown to dominate at low nutrient availability (CITE: cederlund 2014), which may explain why they were not active upon nutrient additions. The <em>Acidobacteria</em> in our microcosms were mainly annotated as belonging to candidate orders in the Silva taxonomic nomenclature. The highest relative abundance for any <em>Acidobacteria</em> order in the bulk samples was 0.20 (order “DA023”) and the highest relative abundance of the Acidobacteria phylum was 0.23.</p>
<h2 id="xylose">Xylose</h2>
<p>All of the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders in the <em>Firmicutes</em> phylum are closely related (at least 99% sequence identity) to cultured isolates from genera that are known to form endospores (Table [tab:xyl]). Each <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder is closely related to isolates annotated as members of <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Paenibacillus</em> or <em>Lysinibacillus</em>. <em>Bacteroidetes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are predominantly closely related to <em>Flavobacterium</em> species (5 of 8 total responders) (Table [tab:xyl]). Only one <em>Bacteroidetes</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responder is not closely related to a cultured isolate, “OTU.183” (closest LTP BLAST hit, <em>Chitinophaca sp.</em>, 89.5% sequence identity, Table [tab:xyl]). OTU.183 shares high sequence identity with environmental clones derived from rhizosphere samples (accession AM158371, unpublished) and the skin microbiome (accession JF219881, <span class="citation">(64)</span>). Other <em>Bacteroidetes</em> responders share high sequence identities with canonical soil genera including <em>Dyadobacer</em>, <em>Solibius</em> and <em>Terrimonas</em>. Six of the 8 <em>Actinobacteria</em> <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responders are in the <em>Micrococcales</em> order. One <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose responding <em>Actinobacteria</em> OTU shares 100% sequence identity with <em>Agromyces ramosus</em> (Table [tab:xyl]). <em>A. ramosus</em> is a known predatory bacterium but is not dependent on a host for growth in culture <span class="citation">(65)</span>. It is not possible to determine the specific origin of assimilated <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C in a DNA-SIP experiment. <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C can be passed down through trophic levels although heavy isotope representation in C pools targeted by cross-feeders and predators would be diluted with depth into the trophic cascade. It is possible, however, that the <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C labeled <em>Agromyces</em> OTU was assimilating <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C primarily by predation if the <em>Agromyces</em> OTU was selective enough with respect to its prey that it primarily attacked <span class="math"><em></em><sup>13</sup></span>C-xylose assimilating organisms.</p>
